abstract = {The relationship between corporate environmental performance and financial performance has 
received a high degree of attention in research literature and the results are still contradictory. 
Most of the findings have shown that environmental performance improves financial performance 
while others have suggested that the relationship is neutral or even negative. Our article 
integrates prior research studying this relationship and identifies the potential moderators that 
may have played a role in the apparent inconsistent results observed to date. We conducted a 
meta-analysis of 52 studies over a 35-year period that confirms a positive relationship between 
environmental performance and financial performance. Moderators’ analysis reveals that the 
relationship is significantly influenced by the environmental and financial performance measures, 
the regional differences, the activity sector and the duration of the studies. After discussing the 
theoretical and managerial implications, this meta-analysis tries to answer the question: “When 
and how does it pay to be green?”}

abstract = {Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental
 performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the
 current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions.
 With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim
 that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky
 grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts,
 we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior
 quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta
analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and,
 to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the
 operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For
 example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures
 of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly
 correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes
 a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP–CFP relationship than is currently
 assumed to exist by many business scholars.}

Since randomized controlled experiments in the “Business-Research” field are often unfeasible, researchers rely mostly on observational data to make claims about “doing good – doing well” arguments. In response to several strong calls for additional well-crafted empirical research that address endogeneity, we revisit the CSP – CFP relationship, in the airline industry, to understand how endogeneity arises and how to control for it in studies based on observational panel data. We exploit various approaches such as OLS, fixed-effects, fixed-effects IV/2SLS, dynamic system GMM, and GLS estimators. We show the appropriateness behind the use of the dynamic system GMM estimator and its benefits over the fixed-effects estimator. In addition, we demonstrate that results in models that do not account for endogeneity lead to inflated estimations, misleading interpretations and wrong theoretical propositions about the dynamic nature of CSP-CFP relationship.},

In addition, the link between CSP and investor utility is investigated. The main findings are that corporate social responsibility is negatively but weakly related to systematic firm risk and that corporate social irresponsibility is positively and strongly related to financial risk. The fact that both conventional and downside risk measures lead to the same conclusions adds convergent validity to the analysis. However, the risk-return trade-off appears to be such that no clear utility gain or loss can be realized by investing in firms characterized by different levels of social and environmental performance. Overall volatility conditions of the financial markets are shown to play a moderating role in the nature and strength of the CSP-risk relationship.},

This inconsistency may be due to flawed empirical analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate a particular flaw in existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance. These studies estimate the effect of CSR by regressing firm performance on corporate social performance, and several control variables. This model is misspecified because it does not control for investment in R\&D, which has been shown to be an important determinant of firm performance. This misspecification results in upwardly biased estimates of the financial impact of CSR. When the model is properly specified, we find that CSR has a neutral impact on financial performance.

First, especially with greater institutional discretion, powerful CEOs pursue exaggerated CSR strategies aiming at reputational gains for their private benefit, while not necessarily bearing the costs of their decisions. Second, such CEO-induced CSR enhancements turn out to be defective CSR overinvestment, ultimately entailing a decrease in firm value. By complementing organizational factors with institutional characteristics, we refute previous contradicting empirical evidence regarding a significant CEO effect and show a conditional relation between CEO power and CSR choice. Our results are robust to alternative sample compositions, different variable definitions, and various methodological specifications.},

abstract = {Strategic managers are consistently faced with the decision of how to allocate scarce corporate resources in an environment that is placing more and more pressures on them. Recent scholarship in strategic management suggests that many of these pressures come directly from sources associated with social issues in management, rather than traditional arenas of strategic management. Using a greatly improved source of data on corporate social performance, this paper reports the results of a rigorous study of the empirical linkages between financial and social performance. Corporate social performance (CSP) is found to be positively associated with prior financial performance, supporting the theory that slack resource availability and CSP are positively related. CSP is also found to be positively associated with future financial performance, supporting the theory that good management and CSP are positively related.© 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

the impact of CSR on firm-level Total Factor Productivity (TFP) as 
well as the possible influence approaches and mechanisms. 
Following previous literature, several predictive models are 
built to draw the following conclusions: (1) CSR significantly 
promotes TFP; (2) the impact of CSR on TFP of family firms is 
greater than that of non-family firms; (3) CSR has a larger posi
tive impact on firms releasing CSR reports voluntarily than on 
those releasing under compulsion; (4) CSR has a greater impact 
on private firms than on state-owned ones, while it has little 
effect on foreign-funded ones; (5) The impact of CSR on TFP is 
robust in high-tech firms, non-high-tech firms, coastal firms, 
non-coastal firms, industrial firms, and service firms. Besides, 
this article finds that financing constraints operate as a major 
channel for CSR to affect TFP, while firms’ irregularity acts only 
as an important channel. Additionally, 2SLS method is 
employed to deal with possible endogenous problems, finding 
that our conclusions remain robust.}

We use the data of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2016. Empirical evidence shows that the number of female directors, the number of female independent directors, female directors’ educational background and monetary compensation upon the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility was not statistically significant. The age and the part-time ratio of female directors were positively correlated with the fulfillment of social responsibilities. The group test based on the “critical number“ in the critical mass theory did not show the changing effect of reaching the “critical number” in the critical mass theory, and the same conclusion was obtained by further testing in terms of the proportion of female directors. This article provides a new perspective for further exploring the board gender diversity and the role of female directors on decision-making, which may be better for companies to fulfill their social responsibilities.}
