  This review explores the growing importance of nature-related financial disclosure standards, such as those proposed by the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and IFRS S1 and S2, and their impact on financial institutions. The review highlights how these standards influence risk management, investment strategies, and regulatory compliance in the financial sector. This review examines how financial institutions integrate nature-related disclosures into their operations, focusing on the identification and management of physical and transition risks, capital allocation, and stress testing. The review also addresses the challenges institutions face, such as limited data availability, the complexity of measuring ecosystem-related risks, and gaps in expertise. The review concludes that while nature-related financial disclosures are still evolving, they represent a critical shift towards integrating environmental sustainability into financial decision-making, with significant implications for the future of global financial markets.

## Introduction

Outline that the review focuses on how financial institutions respond to nature-related financial disclosure standards and the implications of these standards on their operations.



## Overview of Nature-related Financial Disclosure Frameworks 

### Evolution of Nature-Related Disclosure Frameworks

The global landscape of nature-related financial disclosures has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade, transitioning from fragmented voluntary initiatives to increasingly robust, jurisdictionally mandated frameworks. This evolution reflects growing recognition of nature-related risks as material to financial stability, coupled with regulatory efforts to combat greenwashing and harmonize reporting standards. Below, we outline key frameworks driving this shift, with a focus on their progression toward mandatory adoption.

#### Global Frameworks

- **Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)**

Launched in June 2021 and finalized in September 2023, the TNFD builds on the legacy of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by adapting its four-pillar structure — governance, strategy, risk and impact management, and metrics and targets — to address nature-specific risks. While the TCFD (2017) laid the groundwork for voluntary climate disclosures, the TNFD expands this model to include biodiversity loss, water security, and ecosystem degradation [see @TNFD2023]. The framework’s alignment with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is codified in Target 15, which requires corporations to “monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity” by 2030 [@CBD2023]. This positions the TNFD as a critical tool for meeting international commitments.

While the TNFD remains voluntary, its design facilitates regulatory adoption. For example, France’s Energy and Climate Law (2023)[^France]  mandates TNFD-aligned reporting for financial institutions, citing the framework’s “robust methodology for assessing portfolio exposure to biodiversity risks”. Similarly, Brazil’s Central Bank integrates TNFD principles into its sustainability guidelines, emphasizing “location-specific impacts on biomes such as the Amazon” [@STUSSI2024].

The TNFD Enhances the scope by adding 14 new disclosure recommendations to the TCFD’s original 11, emphasizing location-specific impacts, value chain dependencies, and engagement with Indigenous communities. Its LEAP approach (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) provides a standardized methodology for assessing nature-related risks, including for banks to map portfolio exposures [see @TNFD2023LEAP].

- **ISSB Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S1 & S2)**

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), established in 2021 at COP26, aims to unify global sustainability reporting through its IFRS S1 (general sustainability disclosures) and IFRS S2 (climate-specific disclosures). IFRS S1 mandates that sustainability disclosures be “integrated into financial statements to ensure comparability and reliability” [@IFRS2023S1], while IFRS S2 requires granular climate-related risk disclosures, including physical and transition risks [@IFRS2023S2]. These standards consolidate the TCFD’s legacy into a mandatory global baseline, signaling a shift toward mandatory, investor-grade disclosures.

The ISSB standards, endorsed by global organizations such as the G7, G20, and IOSCO, are gaining rapid international adoption. Several jurisdictions, including the UK, Japan, and Singapore, have already announced plans to mandate alignment with IFRS S1 and S2 by 2025. For instance, the UK government’s 2023 policy paper confirms its intent to adopt ISSB standards as the foundation for its UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS), with mandatory disclosures for listed companies by 2025.[^UK]

A key feature of these standards is their integration with financial reporting. Unlike standalone ESG frameworks, IFRS S1 and S2 require sustainability disclosures to be included within annual financial statements, ensuring they are subject to the same level of scrutiny and rigor as financial data. For banks, this means that nature-related risks—such as loans linked to deforestation—must be disclosed alongside traditional financial risks.

Additionally, the ISSB has collaborated with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) to enhance interoperability. This collaboration enables institutions to report both climate and nature-related risks under a unified, compatible structure, simplifying the reporting process while ensuring comprehensive risk assessment [see @TNFD2024].

#### Regional Frameworks

- **European Union**

The EU has pioneered mandatory nature-related disclosures through three interlinked regulations:

  + *EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020)*

The EU Taxonomy serves as a comprehensive classification system designed to identify environmentally sustainable activities, incorporating strict criteria for biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration[^Taxonomy]. It requires in-scope entities, including banks, to disclose Taxonomy-aligned revenue, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures (OpEx). Failure to comply can result in reputational damage and exclusion from sustainable finance markets, such as the EU green bond market [@EBA2022].

  + *Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD, 2023)*

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) replaces the voluntary Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), significantly expanding its scope from 11,000 to over 50,000 EU and non-EU companies by 2027. A cornerstone of the CSRD is its “double materiality” approach, which requires companies, including banks, to report on both financial and impact-related risks. This includes the disclosure of risks to ecosystems alongside traditional financial risks.

The CSRD introduces detailed reporting obligations under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), including ESRS E4 (Biodiversity and Ecosystems). ESRS E4 mandates disclosures on several key aspects:

- Dependencies: For example, the reliance on critical resources such as water for operations;
- Impacts: Such as land degradation linked to lending portfolios;
- Transition Plans: Strategies to mitigate nature-related risks.

Furthermore, ESRS E4 explicitly incorporates metrics from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) for assessing impacts on protected areas, ensuring alignment with established global frameworks [see @EFRAG2022].

  + *Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR, 2021)*

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires financial institutions to classify investment products based on their sustainability objectives under Articles 6, 8, or 9 and to disclose their alignment with the EU Taxonomy.[^SFDR]

Under the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) principle, banks are now obligated to screen investments for activities that may harm biodiversity, such as logging in protected areas. Furthermore, Article 9 of the SFDR mandates comprehensive due diligence to ensure investments do not negatively impact biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of sustainable investment practices.

- **United Kingdom**

The UK’s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) policy framework, as outlined in HM Treasury’s 2023 roadmap, integrates the ISSB standards while mandating the inclusion of “transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).”[^UK]

A key component of this framework is the development of the UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS), which are expected to be finalized by 2025. These standards will adopt ISSB guidelines while incorporating UK-specific requirements, such as transition planning disclosures for high-emitting sectors.

Mandatory disclosures for listed companies will commence in 2026. Banks will be required to report on financed emissions and nature-related risk exposures, with a particular focus on high-impact sectors such as agriculture and mining. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will enforce these disclosure requirements, ensuring compliance by banks starting in 2026 [see @FCA2023].

The SDR explicitly references the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), ensuring consistency with international biodiversity goals and strengthening its alignment with global sustainability frameworks.

- **United States**

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Climate Disclosure Rule (2024) marks the country’s first federal initiative to mandate nature-related disclosures.[^SEC] However, its implementation has been delayed due to ongoing legal challenges.

The rule mandates that public companies disclose material climate risks, such as physical risks from severe weather events (e.g., floods), along with Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, companies must report costs associated with extreme weather impacts.

While federal efforts face delays, California has taken significant steps with the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB 253). Effective in 2026, this law requires companies with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion to report Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The legislation emphasizes addressing systemic risks from biodiversity loss within supply chains, indirectly pressuring banks and financial institutions to assess the nature-related risks of their clients.[^California]

#### From Voluntary to Mandatory: Key Drivers and Challenges

The shift toward mandatory nature-related disclosure frameworks is driven by several key developments, reflecting the growing recognition of environmental risks and the need for harmonized reporting standards. 

- *Recognition of Material Nature-Related Risks*

Increasing awareness of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and water security as critical threats to financial stability has accelerated the move toward mandatory disclosures. Frameworks like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) emphasize the financial materiality of these risks to corporate and institutional performance. The widespread adoption of the TNFD by over 320 institutions, including major banks and asset managers, underscores the influence of investor demand for transparency and the need to assess portfolio exposures to nature-related risks [@TNFD2023].

- *Global Regulatory Alignment*

The harmonization of sustainability reporting standards, led by initiatives such as the ISSB's IFRS S1 and S2 and the TNFD, promotes consistency and comparability across jurisdictions. These frameworks explicitly reference global commitments like the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, solidifying their role in supporting international biodiversity and sustainability goals.

- *Integration with Financial Reporting*

Mandates under frameworks such as the ISSB standards [@IFRS2023S1] and the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) require nature-related disclosures to be included in financial statements. This integration enhances the rigor of sustainability reporting, ensuring it is held to the same standards of accuracy and reliability as financial data.

However, this transition also presents significant challenges that must be addressed for effective implementation.

- *Legal and Political Barriers*

Legal and political resistance has hindered the implementation of mandatory disclosures in some jurisdictions. For example, the SEC’s Climate Disclosure Rule in the United States has faced significant legal challenges, delaying its rollout and highlighting the contentious nature of regulatory enforcement in this domain.

- *Complexity of Frameworks*

The proliferation of overlapping frameworks, including the TNFD, ISSB, and various regional regulations, creates challenges for organizations, particularly those operating in multiple jurisdictions. These entities must navigate differing requirements, increasing the complexity and administrative burden of compliance.

- *Data Availability and Granularity*

Effective nature-related disclosure requires detailed and location-specific data, such as ecosystem impacts and value chain dependencies. Many organizations, especially those in sectors with intricate supply chains, face difficulties in accessing or generating the necessary data to meet disclosure requirements.

## ESG and Banks

### Theoretical Foundation

The relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and financial institutions has garnered increasing scholarly attention, driven by global sustainability challenges. This section synthesizes theoretical frameworks that explain how and why ESG reporting influences financial institutions’ operations, decision-making, and market outcomes. Four interconnected theoretical streams provide the foundation: organizational theories, economic theories, institutional theory, and emerging frameworks such as natural capital and double materiality.

#### Organizational Theories

Organizational theories, particularly stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, highlight the institutional motivations and external pressures driving ESG reporting practices.  Stakeholder theory, developed by @FREEMAN1984 and expanded by subsequent scholars, underscores the need for organizations to address the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Building on this, @MITCHELL1997 proposed the theory of stakeholder salience emphasizing understanding why and how managers prioritize certain stakeholders, rather than prescribing whom they should prioritize. Their theory provides tools to identify stakeholder types via a typology and explain managerial responses through the concept of salience, which assesses stakeholders' legitimacy, power, and urgency. This typology offers a framework for financial institutions to navigate competing stakeholder interests effectively. @DONALDSON1995 provided theoretical justification for stakeholder theory, emphasizing its descriptive, instrumental, and normative validity in explaining corporate behavior. @ROBERTS1992 conducts an arly application of stakeholder theory to explain corporate social responsibility disclosure. The study finds that measures of stakeholder power, strategic posture, and economic performance are significantly associated with levels of corporate social disclosure. 

Legitimacy theory, foundationally developed by @SUCHMAN1995, identifies three primary forms of legitimacy[^03]—pragmatic, moral, and cognitive—that organizations seek to maintain. @DEEGAN2002 applied this framework to environmental and social disclosures, demonstrating how these practices reinforce an organization's legitimacy. 

In the context of financial institutions, empirical studies show that ESG reporting is often used to satisfy stakeholder demands and enhance legitimacy. @THOMPSON2004 examines how banks respond to environmental stakeholders through reporting practices. Their findings reveal that bankers value annual reports for assessing corporate environmental impact, despite their limitations, and express some interest in expanded environmental disclosures. However, their focus primarily aims at safeguarding loans. Similarly, @SCHOLTENS2009 analyze how international banks balance different stakeholder interests through Corporate Social Resbosibility (CSR) reporting, while @CARNEVALE2014 test the direct effects of the sustainability report on stock price in European markets, demonstrating that sustainability reports positively influence stock prices by signaling organizational compliance with evolving norms.

#### Economic Theories

Economic theories, particularly information asymmetry and agency theory, explain how ESG reporting enhances market efficiency and reduces capital costs. @JENSEN1976 established the foundational agency theory framework, explaining the conflicts of interest between principals (shareholders) and agents (managers). This study lays the groundwork for understanding how ESG reporting can mitigate agency costs by aligning stakeholder interests. @AKERLOF1970 work on Information Asymmetry further explains how unequal information among market participants creates inefficiencies. @HART1987 provide a foundation for modern contract theory and influence the theory of the firm and organizational economics. This paper develops the principal-agent model, and demonstrate how disclosure requirements can act as screening devices. @GRAY1996 provide a theoretical framework for understanding the role of corporate social and environmental reporting in addressing information asymmetry and enhancing accountability. Applying these theories, studies have demonstrated that ESG disclosure reduces information gaps and lowers agency costs, thereby enhancing market efficiency. For instance, @DHALIWAL2011 and @ELGHOUL2011 find firms that initiate CSR disclosure and have superior CSR performance (relative to their industry peers) experience a subsequent reduction in their cost of equity capital, and attract more dedicated institutional investors and analyst coverage. Moreover, @CUI2018 observed that CSR engagement is inversely associated with reputational risk, largely due to reduced information asymmetry. 

#### Institutional Theory

Institutional theory explains the standardization and diffusion of reporting practices. @DIMAGGIO1983 identify three mechanisms driving institutional isomorphism: Coercive isomorphism, Mimetic isomorphism and Normative isomorphism. Their foundational study develops a theoretical framework explaining how these mechanisms operate within organizational fields - recognized areas of institutional life where organizations interact under similar pressures. This framework is valuable in understanding the standardization and diffusion of reporting practices across organizations. Coercive isomorphism explains how regulatory requirements and pressure from stakeholders drive adoption of standardized reporting formats. Mimetic isomorphism illuminates why organizations copy "best practice" reporting methods from industry leaders during periods of uncertainty. Normative isomorphism shows how professional networks and training lead to similar reporting approaches across organizations. Empirical research highlights the importance of institutional pressures, including coercive, normative, and mimetic forces, in driving firms to conform to ESG expectations [@DELMAS2004; @HIGGINS2014; @BEBBINGTON2018; @CHRISTENSEN2021]. 

#### Emerging Theoretical Frameworks

Emerging theoretical frameworks around natural capital and double materiality offer novel perspectives on integrating environmental considerations into financial decision-making. Natural capital theory, as articulated by @DASGUPTA2021 and @DAILY2009, emphasizes the valuation of biodiversity and natural capital, with implications for financial modeling [@ATKINSON2014]. @ECCLES2014 provide a theoretical foundation for integrated reporting,  which aligns closely with double materiality. The concept of "double-materiality" was first formally proposed by the European Commission [@EC2019] in Guidelines on Non-financial Reporting: Supplement on Reporting Climate-related Information published in June 2019. It encourages a company to judge materiality from two perspectives 1) “the extent necessary for an understanding of the company’s development, performance and position” and “in the broad sense of affecting the value of the company”; 2) environmental and social impact of the company’s activities on a broad range of stakeholders. 

[^03]: Legitimacy is a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions [@GINZEL2004; @NEILSEN1987; @PERROW1970].

ESG disclosure and reporting has a positive influence on a company's financial performance and risk. ESG reporting is not merely a compliance exercise but a strategic imperative for financial institutions.


### Firm Value and Performance

Stakeholder theories [see @FREEMAN1984; @DEEGAN2002] suggest that when organizations incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices into their long-term strategic planning, they gain competitive advantages by addressing the needs of various groups - from employees and customers to government bodies and community members. This approach recognizes that business success is linked to creating value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. In contrast, the trade-off hypothesis or traditionalist view [see @FRIEDMAN2007] suggests ESG practices negatively impact financial performance by increasing costs, harming corporate performance, and reducing competitive advantage. Scholars argue that focusing on social and environmental goals diverts managers from maximizing shareholder value. Similarly, satisfying non-shareholder stakeholders may hinder profit maximization and value creation for owners and managers[@GALANT2017].

Empirical studies on the relationship between ESG engagement and financial performance have provided conflicting findings. Drawing from empirical analysis using MSCI ESG STATS database ratings, @CORNETT2016 examine the relationship between the US commercial banks' corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and financial performance. The study reveals that larger banks, despite facing criticism for profit-focused practices leading to the crisis, demonstrate consistently higher CSR strengths and concerns. Post-2009, these institutions showed marked improvement with increased CSR strengths and decreased concerns. Similarly, studies such as @CARNEVALE2014, @SHEN2016 and @BUALLAY2021 demonstrate banks's engagement in CSR activities can improve the financial performance. While @FERRERO2016 find a nonlinear relationship between ESG and financial performance employing listed companies in Europe. Moreover, @BUALLAY2023 investigate the effct of sustainability reporting on bank’s performance (operational, ﬁnancial and market) in 7 regions that include 60 countries over the period 2008–2017. They find the negative relationship between ESG disclosures and banks' operational performance (ROA, ROE), and market performance (Tobin’s Q). They argue that sustainability reporting may have negative impact on banks' asset utilization, in line with the trad-off theory [see @LEE2009].


### Bank Risk 

Despite growing scholarly attention to the link between CSR and bank performance, empirical research examining its influence on risk exposure within financial institutions remains limited. The existing literature primarily focuses on individual bank risk metrics. A study by @GANGI2019 examine 142 banks across 35 countries and find that stronger environmental engagement correlates with lower risk profiles as measured by Z-scores [see @LAEVEN2009]. Similarly, @SCHOLTENS2019 report a modest negative relationship between sustainability practices and standalone risk measures among European banks. Aligning with stakeholder theory, @DI_TOMMASO2020 demonstrate that higher ESG scores slightly curbed risk-taking among European banks (2007–2018), though this relationship was mediated by board composition factors including size, independent director presence, and gender diversity. Further evidence from @CHIARAMONTE2022 demonstrate that both aggregate ESG scores and individual pillars enhanced bank stability during financial stress periods, with longer ESG disclosure histories amplifying these stabilizing effects. Expanding geographically, @NEITZERT2022 examine 582 international banks (2002–2018), corroborating the risk-mitigating effects of CSR activities on default and portfolio risks, consistent with risk management frameworks. However, their findings revealed heterogeneity across ESG pillars: environmental (E) initiatives exhibited the strongest and most consistent risk-reduction outcomes, whereas social (S) and governance (G) dimensions yielded less definitive results.

Academic research on the relationship between systemic financial risk and ESG factors remains limited, with existing studies examining each of the three E, S and G pillars respectively. Regarding environmental (E) factors, @ESRB2016 points that an unanticipated rapid green transition could significantly impact asset values, with carbon-intensive investments facing declining profitability while low-carbon assets appreciate. In terms of governance (G) factors, @ANGINER2018 present compelling evidence that shareholder-friendly corporate governance structures correlate with increased bank systemic risk, as measured by Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES)[@ACHARYA2017] and SRISK metrics [@BROWNLEES2017].This relationship appears particularly pronounced for larger banks, potentially due to too-big-to-fail considerations, and is amplified in jurisdictions with more generous financial safety nets. Their findings derive from analyses of both U.S. banks (1990-2014) and international banks (2004-2008), suggesting the robustness of this relationship across different contexts and time periods.  

Using qualitatlive research method, @KUHN2022 investigates sustainable finance disclosures and initiatives in Germany. They find that ESG disclosures enable financial institutions to identify exposure to sectors with high dependency on vulnerable ecosystems. Disclosing these dependencies improves transparency and helps institutions avoid investments in activities contributing to ecological degradation such as deforestation-linked loans. Their stduy proposes integrating natural capital valuation into credit risk assessments to account for "hidden" risks. Case studies demonstrate that institutions adopting such frameworks reduce exposure to stranded assets and regulatory penalties.


### Investment Strategy and Portfolio Alignment

@DEMETRIADES2025 investigate lending patterns between major banks and fossil fuel companies from 2001-2021 using global syndicated loan data. They find a complex dynamic where banks recognize and price in climate risks through higher interest rates and shorter loan terms, yet simultaneously increase loan volumes to brown firms. The findings suggest that regulatory pressure, particularly in Europe and the US, has led to more stringent lending policies, though not necessarily reduced lending volumes.

The research indicates that ESG reporting and compliance have a significant impact on the financial performance and risk management of financial institutions. Regulatory pressure is driving adoption of ESG reporting, but the focus should be on improving ESG outcomes rather than just compliance.


### Double Materiality

@ARAS2024 investigates the SDGs with ESG indicators through a double materiality perspective for 1888 companies from the OECD fnancial institutions. The study shows how commercial banks can identify and prioritize the SDGs and targets and how sustainable practices at the 
corporate level can contribute to achieving these global goals by adopting a sound approach.
