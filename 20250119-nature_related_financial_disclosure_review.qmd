  The global financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift as nature-related risks, from biodiversity loss to ecosystem degradation, emerge as material threats to economic stability. By reviewing the literature, this study advances a novel Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework, integrating stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional isomorphism to explain how banks’ ESG disclosures emerge from dynamic negotiations between external pressures (e.g., regulators, investors) and strategic legitimacy-seeking behaviors. Key findings reveal that while ESG disclosures mitigate bank-specific risks, conflicting evidence persists on their financial performance impacts. Critical gaps include underexplored transmission effects of regulations through lending networks, inconsistent roles of institutional and state ownership, and tensions between symbolic compliance and substantive action.

# Introduction

The global financial system is undergoing a seismic shift as nature-related risks—ranging from biodiversity loss to ecosystem degradation—emerge as material threats to economic stability [@UNEP2023]. Over the past decade, voluntary sustainability frameworks like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) have evolved into robust, jurisdictionally mandated systems, driven by regulatory imperatives to combat greenwashing, harmonize reporting standards, and align financial flows with planetary boundaries. Central to this transformation are frameworks such as the Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), and region-specific regulations like the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the UK’s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR). These frameworks reflect a growing consensus that environmental risks are inextricably linked to financial performance, necessitating disclosures that integrate double materiality—assessing both financial risks to firms and firms’ impacts on ecosystems.

Despite the systemic importance of banks, empirical research on how ESG regulations affect their risk profiles, governance mechanisms, and financial performance remains fragmented. Existing studies disproportionately focus on non-financial firms [e.g. @YOUN2015; @FAVINO2019; @BUALLAY2019; @DYCK2019], leaving critical gaps in understanding banks’ unique intermediation role. For instance, while the TNFD’s LEAP methodology and the ISSB’s IFRS S1 and S2 standards are gaining traction, their sector-specific implications for banking—such as transmission effects through lending networks or the tension between symbolic compliance and substantive action—are underexplored. Theoretical frameworks also remain fragmented, with stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional isomorphism often treated in isolation rather than as interconnected drivers of ESG disclosure. This review addresses these gaps by synthesizing global evidence, proposing an integrated theoretical model, and identifying urgent research priorities at the nexus of finance, regulation, and ecological stewardship.

In this study, we advance a novel Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework [@CAMPBELL2007; @AGUINIS2012] tailored to banks, synthesizing stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional isomorphism. This model positions ESG disclosures as dynamic outcomes of external pressures (e.g., regulators, shareholders) and banks’ legitimacy-seeking behaviors, moderated by economic factors (e.g., bank size) and institutional contexts (e.g., ownership structures). We also find the following critical research gaps: 

- Ownership Dynamics: The role of institutional and state ownership in shaping ESG outcomes remains inconsistent across studies [@DYCK2019; @RAIMO2020], with concentrated ownership marginalizing minority shareholder influence on CSR practices [@SMITH2022].

- Regulatory Efficacy: Sector-specific analyses of mandatory frameworks (e.g., CSRD, EU Taxonomy) are scarce, particularly their impact on bank risk profiles and governance mechanisms.

- Systemic Risk Implications: The interplay between ESG disclosures and systemic financial stability, especially during regulatory shocks (e.g., rapid green transitions), lacks empirical rigor [@ESRB2016].

Our study contributes to sustainable finance research through three key areas:

- Theoretical Innovation: The Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework bridges siloed theories, offering a holistic lens to analyze banks’ ESG disclosures as context-dependent processes shaped by stakeholder pressures and legitimacy imperatives.

- Gap-Driven Agenda: By systematizing underexplored research gaps—such as regulatory transmission mechanisms and ownership dynamics—we provide a roadmap for future studies to address banking-specific complexities.

- Policy Relevance: We identify actionable solutions for regulators, including integrating natural capital valuation into stress testing and harmonizing ISSB-TNFD interoperability to mitigate symbolic compliance risks.

The remainder of the literature review is organized as follows: In Section II, we review the theories underpinning the relationship between ESG disclosure and the banking sector. In Section III, we propose the integrated Stakeholder-Legitimacy framework applied to the banking industry and review the research gaps. Section IV is the conclusion section. An overview of the nature-related financial disclosure frameworks from different dimensions, as background information of this review, is provided in the appendix. 

# ESG disclsoure and Banks

## Theoretical Foundation

The relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and financial institutions has garnered increasing scholarly attention, driven by global sustainability challenges. This section synthesizes theoretical frameworks that explain how and why ESG reporting influences financial institutions’ operations, decision-making, and market outcomes. Four interconnected theoretical streams provide the foundation: organizational theories, economic theories, institutional theory, and emerging frameworks such as natural capital and double materiality.

### Organizational Theories

Organizational theories, particularly stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, highlight the institutional motivations and external pressures driving ESG reporting practices.  Stakeholder theory, developed by @FREEMAN1984, posits that organizations are accountable to a broad range of stakeholders beyond shareholders, including regulators, customers (investors), employees, and civil society. Building on this, @MITCHELL1997 proposed the theory of stakeholder salience emphasizing understanding why and how managers prioritize certain stakeholders, rather than prescribing whom they should prioritize. Their theory provides tools to identify stakeholder types via a typology and explain managerial responses through the concept of salience, which assesses stakeholders' legitimacy, power, and urgency. This typology offers a framework for financial institutions to navigate competing stakeholder interests effectively. @DONALDSON1995 provided theoretical justification for stakeholder theory, emphasizing its descriptive, instrumental, and normative validity in explaining corporate behavior. @ROBERTS1992 conducts an application of stakeholder theory to explain corporate social responsibility disclosure. The study finds that measures of stakeholder power, strategic posture, and economic performance are significantly associated with levels of corporate social disclosure. Banks' ESG disclosure, for instance, on climate risks or green lending portfolios are often framed as responses to investor demands for transparency or regulatory mandates like the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). 

Legitimacy theory, foundationally developed by @SUCHMAN1995, identifies three primary forms of legitimacy[^03]—pragmatic, moral, and cognitive—that organizations seek to maintain. @DEEGAN2002 applied this framework to environmental and social disclosures, demonstrating how these practices reinforce an organization's legitimacy. Firms' legitimacy-seeking behaviors influence the depth and scope of disclosures, with firms in environmentally sensitive industries disclosing more to manage public perception.  

In the context of financial institutions, empirical studies show that ESG reporting is often used to satisfy stakeholder demands and enhance legitimacy. @THOMPSON2004 examines how banks respond to environmental stakeholders through reporting practices. Their findings reveal that bankers value annual reports for assessing corporate environmental impact, despite their limitations, and express some interest in expanded environmental disclosures. However, their focus primarily aims at safeguarding loans. Similarly, @SCHOLTENS2009 analyze how international banks balance different stakeholder interests through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting, while @CARNEVALE2014 test the direct effects of the sustainability report on stock price in European markets, demonstrating that sustainability reports positively influence stock prices by signaling organizational compliance with evolving norms. @MURE2021 provide empirical evidence supporting stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory that ESG disclosure and performance can be used by banks as a tool to manage their reputation and maintain stakeholder trust, especially in the face of adverse events.


### Economic Theories

Economic theories, particularly information asymmetry and agency theory, explain how ESG reporting enhances market efficiency and reduces capital costs. @JENSEN1976 established the foundational agency theory framework, explaining the conflicts of interest between principals (shareholders) and agents (managers). This study lays the groundwork for understanding how ESG reporting can mitigate agency costs by aligning stakeholder interests. @AKERLOF1970 work on Information Asymmetry further explains how unequal information among market participants creates inefficiencies. @HART1987 provide a foundation for modern contract theory and influence the theory of the firm and organizational economics. This paper develops the principal-agent model, and demonstrate how disclosure requirements can act as screening devices. @GRAY1996 provide a theoretical framework for understanding the role of corporate social and environmental reporting in addressing information asymmetry and enhancing accountability. Applying these theories, studies have demonstrated that ESG disclosure reduces information gaps and lowers agency costs, thereby enhancing market efficiency. For instance, @DHALIWAL2011 and @ELGHOUL2011 find firms that initiate CSR disclosure and have superior CSR performance (relative to their industry peers) experience a subsequent reduction in their cost of equity capital, and attract more dedicated institutional investors and analyst coverage. Moreover, @CUI2018 observed that CSR engagement is inversely associated with reputation risk, largely due to reduced information asymmetry. 

### Institutional Isomorphism Framework

Institutional isomorphism framework explains the standardization and diffusion of reporting practices. @DIMAGGIO1983 identify three mechanisms driving institutional isomorphism: Coercive isomorphism, Mimetic isomorphism and Normative isomorphism. Their foundation study develops a theoretical framework explaining how these mechanisms operate within organizational fields - recognized areas of institutional life where organizations interact under similar pressures. This framework is valuable in understanding the standardization and diffusion of reporting practices across organizations. Coercive isomorphism explains how regulatory requirements and pressure from stakeholders drive adoption of standardized reporting formats. Mimetic isomorphism illuminates why organizations copy "best practice" reporting methods from industry leaders during periods of uncertainty. Normative isomorphism shows how professional networks and training lead to similar reporting approaches across organizations. Empirical research highlights the importance of institutional pressures, including coercive, normative, and mimetic forces, in driving firms to conform to ESG expectations [@DELMAS2004; @HIGGINS2014; @BEBBINGTON2018; @CHRISTENSEN2021]. 

### Emerging Theoretical Concepts

Emerging theoretical concepts and analytical lenses around natural capital and double materiality offer novel perspectives on integrating environmental considerations into financial decision-making. Natural capital concept, as articulated by @DASGUPTA2021 and @DAILY2009, emphasizes the valuation of biodiversity and natural capital, with implications for financial modeling [@ATKINSON2014]. @ECCLES2014 provide a theoretical foundation for integrated reporting,  which aligns closely with double materiality. The concept of "double-materiality" was first formally proposed by the European Commission [@EC2019] in Guidelines on Non-financial Reporting: Supplement on Reporting Climate-related Information published in June 2019; then was formalized by the regulation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)[see @EU_CSRD_2022] as a reporting requirement. It mandates a company to judge materiality from two perspectives 1) “the extent necessary for an understanding of the company’s development, performance and position” and “in the broad sense of affecting the value of the company”; 2) environmental and social impact of the company’s activities on a broad range of stakeholders. 

[^03]: Legitimacy is a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions [@GINZEL2004; @NEILSEN1987; @PERROW1970].

ESG disclosure and reporting has a positive influence on a company's financial performance and risk. ESG reporting is not merely a compliance exercise but a strategic imperative for financial institutions.

## Empirical Research

### Firm Value and Performance

Stakeholder theories [see @FREEMAN1984; @DEEGAN2002] suggest that when organizations incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices into their long-term strategic planning, they gain competitive advantages by addressing the needs of various groups - from employees and customers to government bodies and community members. This approach recognizes that business success is linked to creating value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. The stakholders reward companys with good ESG practices through investment, consumption and higher productivity [@LI2018]In contrast, the trade-off hypothesis or traditionalist view [see @FRIEDMAN2007] suggests ESG practices negatively impact financial performance by increasing costs, harming corporate performance, and reducing competitive advantage. Scholars argue that focusing on social and environmental goals diverts managers from maximizing shareholder value. Similarly, satisfying non-shareholder stakeholders may hinder profit maximization and value creation for owners and managers[@GALANT2017].

Empirical studies on the relationship between ESG engagement and financial performance have provided conflicting findings. Driven by stakeholder theory, @WU2013 find that ESG disclosures improve bank profitability by attracting ESG-conscious investors. Their findings attribute to stakeholder pressure for transparency. Drawing from empirical analysis using MSCI ESG STATS database ratings, @CORNETT2016 examine the relationship between the US commercial banks' corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and financial performance. The study reveals that larger banks, despite facing criticism for profit-focused practices leading to the crisis, demonstrate consistently higher CSR strengths and concerns. Post-2009, these institutions showed marked improvement with increased CSR strengths and decreased concerns. Similarly, studies such as @CARNEVALE2014, @SHEN2016 and @BUALLAY2021 demonstrate banks' engagement in CSR activities can improve the financial performance. @TIAN2023 report that banks with green credit announcement show better market value and long-term performance. While @FERRERO2016 find a nonlinear relationship between ESG and financial performance employing listed companies in Europe. Moreover, @BUALLAY2023 investigate the effect of sustainability reporting on bank performance (operational, financial and market) in 7 regions that include 60 countries over the period 2008-2017. They find the negative relationship between ESG disclosures and banks' operational performance (ROA, ROE), and market performance (Tobin's Q). They argue that sustainability reporting may have negative impact on banks' asset utilization, in line with the trad-off theory [see @LEE2009].


### Bank Risk 

Despite growing scholarly attention to the link between CSR and bank performance, empirical research examining its influence on risk exposure within financial institutions remains limited. The existing literature primarily focuses on individual bank risk metrics. A study by @GANGI2019 examine 142 banks across 35 countries and find that stronger environmental engagement correlates with lower risk profiles as measured by Z-scores [see @LAEVEN2009]. Similarly, @SCHOLTENS2019 report a modest negative relationship between sustainability practices and standalone risk measures among European banks. Aligning with stakeholder theory, @DI_TOMMASO2020 demonstrate that higher ESG scores slightly curbed risk-taking among European banks (2007–2018), though this relationship was mediated by board composition factors including size, independent director presence, and gender diversity. @GANGWANI2024 report that higher ESG disclosure scores correlate with reduced commercial banking risks, specifically mitigating insolvency, leverage, and liquidity challenges. Further evidence from @CHIARAMONTE2022 demonstrate that both aggregate ESG scores and individual pillars enhanced bank stability during financial stress periods, with longer ESG disclosure histories amplifying these stabilizing effects. Expanding geographically, @NEITZERT2022 examine 582 international banks (2002–2018), corroborating the risk-mitigating effects of CSR activities on default and portfolio risks, consistent with risk management frameworks. However, their findings revealed heterogeneity across ESG pillars: environmental (E) initiatives exhibited the strongest and most consistent risk-reduction outcomes, whereas social (S) and governance (G) dimensions yielded less definitive results.

Academic research on the relationship between systemic financial risk and ESG factors remains limited, with existing studies examining each of the three E, S and G pillars respectively. Regarding environmental (E) factors, @ESRB2016 points that an unanticipated rapid green transition could significantly impact asset values, with carbon-intensive investments facing declining profitability while low-carbon assets appreciate. In terms of governance (G) factors, @ANGINER2018 present compelling evidence that shareholder-friendly corporate governance structures correlate with increased bank systemic risk, as measured by Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES)[@ACHARYA2017] and SRISK metrics [@BROWNLEES2017].This relationship appears particularly pronounced for larger banks, potentially due to too-big-to-fail considerations, and is amplified in jurisdictions with more generous financial safety nets. Their findings derive from analyses of both U.S. banks (1990-2014) and international banks (2004-2008), suggesting the robustness of this relationship across different contexts and time periods.  

Using qualitative research method, @KUHN2022 investigates sustainable finance disclosures and initiatives in Germany. They find that ESG disclosures enable financial institutions to identify exposure to sectors with high dependency on vulnerable ecosystems. Disclosing these dependencies improves transparency and helps institutions avoid investments in activities contributing to ecological degradation such as deforestation-linked loans. Their study proposes integrating natural capital valuation into credit risk assessments to account for "hidden" risks. Case studies demonstrate that institutions adopting such frameworks reduce exposure to stranded assets and regulatory penalties.


### Investment Strategy and Portfolio Alignment

Banks have revised their approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR), placing greater emphasis on managing both direct and indirect risks associated with lending to firms facing environmental and social challenges [@CARNEVALE2012]. Drawn on the stakeholder theory, @GOSS2011 examine the link between CSR and the cost of bank loans. They find that firms with poor CSR performance face higher loan costs due to the creditor risk perceptions. 

@DEMETRIADES2025 investigate lending patterns between major banks and fossil fuel companies from 2001-2021 using global syndicated loan data. They find a complex dynamic where banks recognize and price in climate risks through higher interest rates and shorter loan terms, yet simultaneously increase loan volumes to brown firms. The findings suggest that regulatory pressure, particularly in Europe and the US, has led to more stringent lending policies, though not necessarily reduced lending volumes.

@BASU2022 report that high-ESG banks complement, rather than substitute, mortgage lending with community development investments in poor areas. However, banks are more likely to reject mortgage applications from these communities, suggesting social washing—using pro-social rhetoric while limiting actual support. Their findings align with the legitimacy theory, as banks appear to engage in CSR initiatives to maintain societal approval rather than genuinely addressing financial inclusion and social responsibility.


### Double Materiality

@ARAS2024 investigates the SDGs with ESG indicators through a double materiality perspective for 1888 companies from the OECD financial institutions. The study shows how commercial banks can identify and prioritize the SDGs and targets and how sustainable practices at the 
corporate level can contribute to achieving these global goals by adopting a sound approach. 



## Research Gap and Proposed Framework

In the early 2000s, @HOOGHIEMSTRA2000 argues that sustainability reporting research exhibits diverse and inconsistent findings, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. The research asserts that legitimacy was the dominant perspective. @SPENCE2010 identified stakeholder theory as the predominant and most effective framework for explaining sustainability reporting practices. They also point out that while many studies mention stakeholders in general, they do not explicitly reference stakeholder theory or other theoretical frameworks. Our review confirms their observations in the literature of banks' ESG disclosure. The majority of the studies show a preoccupation with stakeholder theory [@GALANT2017; @SHEN2016; @BUALLAY2021], legitimacy theory [e.g. @CARNEVALE2014], and to some extent also institutional theory [@HIGGINS2014; @BEBBINGTON2018; @CHRISTENSEN2021]. Moreover, these studies primarily rely on isolated theoretical frameworks rather than adopting a more holistic approach that integrates multiple theoretical perspectives on ESG disclosure. In this review we propose an integrated Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework of banks' ESG disclosure, which synthesizes and extends insights from @CAMPBELL2007 institutional-economic model and @AGUINIS2012 multilevel CSR analysis. At its core, the framework positions ESG disclosures as outcomes of dynamic negotiations between stakeholder pressures and legitimacy-seeking behaviors, moderated by banks' economic and institutional contexts.

In the integrated framework (@fig-flowchart), stakeholder pressures act as catalysts for banks' ESG disclosures. According to stakeholder theory, companies should consider and balance the diverse viewpoints and expectations of all groups affected by or invested in their operations, rather than focusing solely on shareholders [@BUCHHOLZ2005; @LAPLUME2008]. @FREEMAN1984 suggests that company management should stay attuned to changing dynamics and trends affecting both their organization's internal constituents and outside parties. Stakeholder pressures arise from key external actors, including regulators, investors, and customers. These actors demand greater transparency and accountability, motivating banks to provide valuable explanations of how they answer to the societal call for sustainable business conduct. Banks respond to these pressures through strategic legitimacy-seeking behaviors. Banks' ESG disclosures range from symbolic gestures (e.g. adopting TCFD guidelines without operational changes) to substantive actions such as phasing out coal financing. Crucially, legitimacy is not a static achievement but an ongoing process; banks must continuously adapt to shifting norms, such as the rise of the TNFD as a biodiversity benchmark. In the stakeholder-legitimacy context, influential stakeholders execute greater pressure on companies to explain and justify their business conduct. Therefore, sustainable reporting and disclosed ESG information serve as a way for companies to establish and maintain their legitimacy in the eyes of these stakeholders [@CAMPBELL_D2003]. 

The integrated framework further incorporates moderating contexts that shape ESG disclosures produced by the translation of stakeholder pressures into banks' legitimacy-seeking behaviors, including economic conditions such as size and profitability, and institutional context such as ownership structure and regulatory regimes. 


### Bank Size and Financial Perfromance

Firm size (usually measured by total assets or market capitalization) can be considered to have a positive effect on the adoption and extent of ESG disclosure. As ESG engagements involve complex processes and require a large scale to be effective [@YOUN2015], firm size is a critical factor in making them successful. Furthermore, according to academic research, company visibility plays a crucial role in engaging a broader and more heterogeneous set of stakeholders [@PELOZA2006]. Visibility encourages organizations to adhere to social pressures and to be more sensitive to stakeholders' expectations. And firm size is positively associated with company visability [@MEZNAR1995]. Therefore, companies with significant market visibility tend to prioritize enhanced sustainability initiatives, motivated by the desire to maintain a positive reputation among their stakeholders [@DAMATO2020; @ABDI2022]. The empirical studies of @FAVINO2019 and @ALAREENI2020 support this viewpoint. They conclude that firm size is an important determinant of ESG scores, as larger firms have more available resources to provide ESG data and are more likely to have their ESG data available. @DREMPETIC2020 find that larger firms tend to have higher ESG scores compared to smaller firms. They also argue that size bias in ESG ratings practice, with larger firms receiving systematically better ESG evaluations. @BUALLAY2019 and @LAMANDA2024 find consistent empirical results in banking sector. 

A body of literature study the relation between ESG disclosure/performance and financial performance, mostly focusing on the impact of ESG activities on financial performance [@FAVINO2019; @BUALLAY2019; @DAMATO2020; @ABDI2022; @LAMANDA2024]. Financial performance as a determinant of ESG disclosure receives less academic attention. Due to their higher ability and flexibility of handling the costs of disclosing, companies with higher profitability (lower leverage and gearing) are often presumed by researchers to be better positioned to cope with any negative impacts that might arise from revealing unfavorable information in their ESG disclosure. However, the empirical results are mixed. @BRAMMER2008 report that firms with higher leverage are less likely to make voluntary environmental disclosures due to financial constraints and costs. The positive relationship between profitability (measured by return on assets (ROA), or return on equity (ROE)) are reported by @HADDOCK2005, @LIU2009 and @GAMERSCHLAG2011. Their studies argue that profitable companies are more likely to disclose ESG information as they have more resources available to absorb the associated costs. While @DYDUCH2017 do not find a significant relationship between financial performance and sustainability reporting in Polish listed companies. @YUEN2022 report a U-shaped relationship between ESG activities and bank profitability.   


### Ownership and Regulation  

Ownership structure and regulation can be considered as external influential factors that are beyond management control. Studies examining different ownership variables have emerged primarily in recent years. The most investigated ownership structure include a company's listing status (publicly listed), institutional shareholding, government involvement (state-owned), and shareholding concentration. 

Publicly listed companies, in order to comply with regulations and to be aligned with industry best practices, as well as to stay attuned to stakeholder pressure and see societal legitimacy, tend to be actively engaged in ESG reporting. @HADDOCK2005 reports that public offering is linked to greater adoption of social reporting practices. Additionally, publicly listed companies tend to disclose more sustainability-related information [@GAMERSCHLAG2011]. The publicly listed ownership structure was primarily examined as a variable in studies conducted before 2015. However, around 2020, publicly listed companies were more commonly used as data samples rather than as a subject of ownership structure analysis [e.g. @SAHASRANAMAM2020; @AMEEN2022; @ALOBAID2024]. In more recent research, institutional shareholding has emerged as a key variable of interest, such as @DYCK2019, @CHEN2020, and @AMEEN2022. Institutional investors are defined as pension funds, insurance companies, banks, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutions that manage and invest funds on behalf of their beneficiaries; they are major players in the global financial markets [@AMEEN2022]. Aligned with agency theory, @SHLEIFER1986 posit that institutional investors, leveraging their significant equity stakes and specialized expertise, closely monitor corporate operations. This oversight helps mitigate agency costs by ensuring management decisions align with shareholder priorities, ultimately promoting more efficient investment practices such as facilitating takeovers. Due to their influential position, institutional investors can shape companies' ESG initiatives by execute the stakeholder pressure on management to disclose greater ESG-related data, aiming to fulfill non-financial goals and bolster both their own and the firms' public image [@DYCK2019; @GARCIA-SANCHEZ2020]. Nevertheless, empirical literature provides inconsistent findings. Some studies indicate that there is a positive association between institutional ownership and ESG performance [@DYCK2019; @CHEN2020; @AMEEN2022; @RAIMO2020]. @ZHOU2019 repots that higher institutional ownership can facilitate firms’ transparency by providing voluntary CSR reports. @ALUCHNA2022 find a negative association between institutional ownership and disclosure of the social performance.  @QU2007 produces insignificant results on the relationship between corporate ownership, including institutional ownership and state ownership, and a company’s CSR engagement. 

While institutional investors’ role in ESG practices has garnered significant attention, the influence of state ownership introduces distinct dynamics, particularly in balancing public policy objectives with corporate accountability and transparency. @TAGESSON2009 find that State-owned corporations disclose more social information than privately owned corporations. One explanation is that state-owned corporations face heightened scrutiny, with pressure from their government stakeholders and public/media attention driving demands for accountability. These entities appear to have responded by aligning with stakeholder demands, reflecting compliance with external expectations. This fiding is also aligned with the social view of state ownership theory [see @STIGLITZ1993] that state ownership addresses market failures and improve social welfare.  @LAU2016 and @ZHOU2019 support the social view that state ownership has a significant positive impact on firms’ CSR disclosure decisions. @BOSE2018 demonstrate that higher institutional ownership leads to higher green banking disclosure. However, @RAIMO2020 report a negative relationship between state ownership and integrated report quality. Shareholding concentration can mean that one or several shareholders have substantial minority ownership stakes and voting rights, such as 10 or 20 percent [@SHLEIFER1997]. Corporate governance literature highlights the frequent comprimise of minority shareholder rights in firms dominant controlling shareholders, where concentrated ownership can lead to power imbalances and disproportionate influence over strategic decisions [@SMITH2022]. Therefore, @SMITH2022 demonstrate that controlling shareholders are less motivated to provide CSR information, with minority shareholders have less power in CSR disclosure practices. @BORGES2024 report that large sharehoders have low interest in the firm's CSR reporting. This result corroborates the finding by @DUCASSY2015 that dominant shareholders lack incentives to allocate resources to social initiatives in contexts with limited stakeholder pressures to legitimize corporate operations, which aligns with stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory. @LAU2016 also report that higher ownership concentration negatively affects CSR performance.  

Studies that exmaine the influence of ESG regulations are still scarce. @HESS2007 suggests that current vulantary initialtives of social reporting are insufficienct to achieve coporate accountability. The study argues, aligned with ligitamacy theory, that social reporting is often driven by strategic considerations rather than a genuine commitment to accountability. Companies may engage in social reporting as a form of "impression management" to portray a positive image, rather than to provide meaningful and transparent information to stakeholders. @HESS_etal2007 suggest that an overarching mendatory social reporting system as the appropriate reporting system to avoid corporate strategic disclosing behavior. @QU2007 argues that the robustness and enforcement of government regulations critically shape the scope and depth of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, underscoring regulatory frameworks as a catalyst in advancing CSR practices by institutionalizing corporate accountability and alignment with societal expectations. @DESAI2024 reports that stock market investors reacts positively to the mandatory ESG disclosure regulation because mandatory ESG disclosure is considered as a positive signal by reducing information asymmetry. @KRUEGER2024 demonstrate that mandatroy ESG disclosure improve firms' liquidity, mitigating adverse selection problem. They also observe improvements in liquidity as markets anticipate the introduction of mandatory ESG disclosure regulations, reflecting proactive adjustments to expected regulatory changes. @LEE2024 find that compulsory ESG disclosure regulation signifies the negative impact of ESG scores on firms' extreme risks; the effect is amplified in cases where firms issue green bonds. @CICCHIELLO2023 examine the effects of NFRD. They argue that government-mandated ESG disclosure regulations targeting corporate social and environmental impacts are proven to strengthen both the rigor and reliability of corporate disclosure practices, fostering greater societal accountability. @BOSE2018 demonstate that green banking regulatory framework has positive association with green banking disclosure practices. However, @MANOS2024 report that self-regulated banks have higher ESG scores by adopting Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). Additionally, their findings reveal the negative impact of regulatory quality on ESG disclosure performance. They argue that banks use mandatory ESG disclosure as a leverage to seek ligitimacy in weaker institutional environment. 

This section presents an integrated Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework, tailored to the banking sector, to explain banks’ ESG disclosure practices, synthesizing stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional contexts into a cohesive analytical pathway. The framework posits that ESG disclosures arise from dynamic interactions between external stakeholder pressures (e.g., regulators, investors, customers) and banks’ legitimacy-seeking behaviors, moderated by economic factors (e.g., size, profitability) and institutional conditions (e.g., ownership structure, regulatory regimes). By bridging insights from @CAMPBELL2007 and @AGUINIS2012, the framework advances a holistic view of ESG reporting as a negotiated outcome of strategic adaptation to stakeholder demands and institutional expectations.

Critical research gaps persist, however. First, while institutional and state ownership structures are increasingly scrutinized, findings remain inconsistent: institutional ownership’s role in ESG performance varies across studies [e.g., @DYCK2019; @ALUCHNA2022], and state ownership’s dual mandate for social welfare and corporate accountability lacks consensus [@TAGESSON2009; @RAIMO2020]. Second, the moderating role of regulatory frameworks is underexplored, particularly in the highly regulated banking sector. Empirical research on how mandatory ESG regulations (e.g., CSRD, EU Taxonomy) shape bank risk profiles, financial performance, and governance mechanisms remains scarce, despite the systemic importance of banks and their unique exposure to ESG-related risks. While studies have begun analyzing disclosure quality versus symbolic compliance in non-financial sectors [@CICCHIELLO2023; @MANOS2024], sector-specific analyses for banking—where regulatory pressures intersect with complex risk intermediation roles—are urgently needed. Third, compounding this complexity, banks’ dual role in ESG ecosystems warrants deeper scrutiny: as both reporting entities subject to disclosure mandates and financing intermediaries influencing firms’ access to green capital, they create transmission effects that amplify regulatory impacts across economies. For instance, @WANG2023 demonstrates that ESG disclosure regulations propagate through bank lending networks, altering borrowers’ environmental practices even without direct regulatory coverage—a phenomenon underexplored in the literature. Fourth, mixed evidence on the relationship between financial performance and ESG disclosure—such as conflicting results on profitability [@HADDOCK2005; @DYDUCH2017]—highlights the need for contextualized analyses. Finally, concentrated ownership’s tendency to marginalize minority shareholder influence on CSR practices [@SMITH2022; @BORGES2024] underscores a governance gap in aligning dominant shareholders with broader stakeholder expectations. These gaps signal opportunities for future research to refine the framework, particularly in disentangling ownership dynamics, regulatory efficacy, and the interplay between symbolic and substantive ESG strategies across diverse institutional settings.



# Conclusion

The transition from voluntary ESG initiatives to mandatory disclosure frameworks marks a paradigm shift in how financial institutions conceptualize and manage nature-related risks. Global frameworks like the TNFD and ISSB, alongside regional regulations such as the EU Taxonomy and CSRD, have established rigorous reporting standards that integrate environmental impacts into financial decision-making. For banks, these mandates necessitate not only transparency about their own operations but also heightened scrutiny of borrowers’ sustainability practices [see @WANG2023], creating cascading effects across economies. Empirical evidence suggests that ESG disclosures can mitigate bank-specific risks—such as insolvency and liquidity challenges—while improving market efficiency through reduced information asymmetry [@GANGI2019; @SCHOLTENS2019; @GANGWANI2024]. However, conflicting findings on the financial performance-ESG relationship and the role of ownership structures underscore the need for contextualized analyses.

To address these complexities, this review advances the Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework and tailor it to the banking sector. This framework synthesizes stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional isomorphism to explain how banks’ ESG disclosures emerge from dynamic negotiations between external pressures (e.g., regulators, investors) and legitimacy-seeking behaviors. It posits that banks balance competing stakeholder demands—such as investor calls for transparency and regulatory mandates for biodiversity due diligence—through strategic disclosures that range from symbolic compliance (e.g., superficial TNFD adoption) to substantive action (e.g., divesting from deforestation-linked assets). Crucially, the framework incorporates moderating factors such as ownership structures (e.g., institutional ownership, state ownership) and regulatory regimes (e.g., mandatory CSRD, vuluntary IFRS S1 and S2 adoption), offering a nuanced lens to analyze how economic and institutional contexts shape disclosure outcomes [@CAMPBELL2007; @AGUINIS2012]. 

Critical research gaps persist. First, the inconsistent role of institutional and state ownership in shaping ESG outcomes highlights the need for granular studies on how governance models mediate regulatory compliance. Second, the banking sector’s dual role as both reporting entities and financial intermediaries remains underexplored, particularly in how disclosure mandates transmit through lending networks to influence unregulated firms. Third, the interplay between symbolic compliance (e.g., adopting TNFD guidelines superficially) and substantive action (e.g., phasing out deforestation-linked loans) demands sector-specific inquiry, given banks’ systemic importance and complex risk intermediation functions. Finally, the marginalization of minority shareholders in CSR decision-making, coupled with concentrated ownership structures, reveals governance deficiencies that hinder stakeholder alignment.

Future research may prioritize three avenues: (1) disentangling the economic and institutional factors that drive ESG disclosure quality in banks; (2) evaluating the systemic risk implications of nature-related regulatory shocks; for instance, assess how nature-related disclosures influence systemic risk within the banking sector and the wider economy; and (3) exploring the interaction between stakeholder-legitimacy framework and institutional isomorphism framework, to assess how coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures shape banks' ESG disclosure practices. By focusing on these three research avenues through the lens of the Stakeholder-Legitimacy Framework, scholars and policymakers can enhance our understanding of ESG disclosure dynamics in the banking sector. This will not only refine regulatory architectures but also ensure that ESG disclosures go beyond compliance checklists to drive meaningful progress. 


# Appendix: Overview of Nature-related Financial Disclosure Frameworks

## Evolution of Nature-Related Disclosure Frameworks

The global landscape of nature-related financial disclosures has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade, transitioning from fragmented, voluntary initiatives to increasingly standardized and jurisdictionally mandated frameworks. This evolution reflects growing recognition of nature-related risks as material to financial stability, coupled with regulatory efforts to combat greenwashing and harmonize reporting standards [@TNFD2023; @IFRS2023S1]. Below, we outline key frameworks driving this shift, with a focus on their progression toward mandatory adoption.

### Global Frameworks

- **Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)**

Launched in June 2021 and finalized in September 2023, the TNFD builds on the legacy of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by adapting its four-pillar structure — governance, strategy, risk and impact management, and metrics and targets — to address nature-specific risks. While the TCFD (2017) laid the groundwork for voluntary climate disclosures, the TNFD expands this model to include biodiversity loss, water security, and ecosystem degradation [see @TNFD2023]. The framework’s alignment with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is codified in Target 15, which requires corporations to “monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity” by 2030 [@CBD2023]. This positions the TNFD as a critical tool for meeting international commitments.

While the TNFD remains voluntary, its design facilitates regulatory adoption. For example, France’s Energy and Climate Law (2023)[^France]  mandates TNFD-aligned reporting for financial institutions, citing the framework’s “robust methodology for assessing portfolio exposure to biodiversity risks”. Similarly, Brazil’s Central Bank integrates TNFD principles into its sustainability guidelines, emphasizing “location-specific impacts on biomes such as the Amazon” [@STUSSI2024].

The TNFD Enhances the scope by adding 14 new disclosure recommendations to the TCFD’s original 11, emphasizing location-specific impacts, value chain dependencies, and engagement with Indigenous communities. Its LEAP approach (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) provides a standardized methodology for assessing nature-related risks, including for banks to map portfolio exposures [see @TNFD2023LEAP].

- **ISSB Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S1 & S2)**

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), established in 2021 at COP26, aims to unify global sustainability reporting through its IFRS S1 (general sustainability disclosures) and IFRS S2 (climate-specific disclosures). IFRS S1 mandates that sustainability disclosures be “integrated into financial statements to ensure comparability and reliability” [@IFRS2023S1], while IFRS S2 requires granular climate-related risk disclosures, including physical and transition risks [@IFRS2023S2]. These standards consolidate the TCFD’s legacy into a mandatory global baseline, signaling a shift toward mandatory, investor-grade disclosures.

The ISSB standards, endorsed by global organizations such as the G7, G20, and IOSCO, are gaining rapid international adoption. Several jurisdictions, including the UK, Japan, and Singapore, have already announced plans to mandate alignment with IFRS S1 and S2 by 2025. For instance, the UK government’s 2023 policy paper confirms its intent to adopt ISSB standards as the foundation for its UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS), with mandatory disclosures for listed companies by 2025.[^UK]

A key feature of these standards is their integration with financial reporting. Unlike standalone ESG frameworks, IFRS S1 and S2 require sustainability disclosures to be included within annual financial statements, ensuring they are subject to the same level of scrutiny and rigor as financial data. For banks, this means that nature-related risks—such as loans linked to deforestation—must be disclosed alongside traditional financial risks.

Additionally, the ISSB has collaborated with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) to enhance interoperability. This collaboration enables institutions to report both climate and nature-related risks under a unified, compatible structure, simplifying the reporting process while ensuring comprehensive risk assessment [see @TNFD2024].

The alignment of IFRS S1 and S2 with relevant ESG disclosure frameworks including TNFD is presented in @fig-IFRS.

### Regional Frameworks

- **European Union**

The EU has pioneered mandatory nature-related disclosures through three interlinked regulations:

  + *EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020)*

The EU Taxonomy serves as a comprehensive classification system designed to identify environmentally sustainable activities, incorporating strict criteria for biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration[^Taxonomy]. It requires in-scope entities, including banks, to disclose Taxonomy-aligned revenue, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures (OpEx). Failure to comply can result in reputational damage and exclusion from sustainable finance markets, such as the EU green bond market [@EBA2022].

  + *Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD, 2023)*

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) replaces the voluntary Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), significantly expanding its scope from 11,000 to over 50,000 EU and non-EU companies by 2027. A cornerstone of the CSRD is its “double materiality” approach, which requires companies, including banks, to report on both financial and impact-related risks. This includes the disclosure of risks to ecosystems alongside traditional financial risks.

The CSRD introduces detailed reporting obligations under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), including ESRS E4 (Biodiversity and Ecosystems). ESRS E4 mandates disclosures on several key aspects:

- Dependencies: For example, the reliance on critical resources such as water for operations;
- Impacts: Such as land degradation linked to lending portfolios;
- Transition Plans: Strategies to mitigate nature-related risks.

Furthermore, ESRS E4 explicitly incorporates metrics from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) for assessing impacts on protected areas, ensuring alignment with established global frameworks [see @EFRAG2022].

  + *Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR, 2021)*

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires financial institutions to classify investment products based on their sustainability objectives under Articles 6, 8, or 9 and to disclose their alignment with the EU Taxonomy.[^SFDR]

Under the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) principle, banks are now obligated to screen investments for activities that may harm biodiversity, such as logging in protected areas. Furthermore, Article 9 of the SFDR mandates comprehensive due diligence to ensure investments do not negatively impact biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of sustainable investment practices.

[^SFDR]: see <https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/disclosures/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en>

- **United Kingdom**

The UK’s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) policy framework, as outlined in HM Treasury’s 2023 roadmap, integrates the ISSB standards while mandating the inclusion of “transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).”[^UK]

A key component of this framework is the development of the UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS), which are expected to be finalized by 2025. These standards will adopt ISSB guidelines while incorporating UK-specific requirements, such as transition planning disclosures for high-emitting sectors.

Mandatory disclosures for listed companies will commence in 2026. Banks will be required to report on financed emissions and nature-related risk exposures, with a particular focus on high-impact sectors such as agriculture and mining. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will enforce these disclosure requirements, ensuring compliance by banks starting in 2026 [see @FCA2023].

The SDR explicitly references the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), ensuring consistency with international biodiversity goals and strengthening its alignment with global sustainability frameworks.

- **United States**

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Climate Disclosure Rule (2024) marks the country’s first federal initiative to mandate nature-related disclosures.[^SEC] However, its implementation has been delayed due to ongoing legal challenges.

The rule mandates that public companies disclose material climate risks, such as physical risks from severe weather events (e.g., floods), along with Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, companies must report costs associated with extreme weather impacts.

While federal efforts face delays, California has taken significant steps with the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB 253). Effective in 2026, this law requires companies with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion to report Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The legislation emphasizes addressing systemic risks from biodiversity loss within supply chains, indirectly pressuring banks and financial institutions to assess the nature-related risks of their clients.[^California]

### From Voluntary to Mandatory: Key Drivers and Challenges

The shift toward mandatory nature-related disclosure frameworks is driven by several key developments, reflecting the growing recognition of environmental risks and the need for harmonized reporting standards. 

- *Recognition of Material Nature-Related Risks*

Increasing awareness of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and water security as critical threats to financial stability has accelerated the move toward mandatory disclosures. Frameworks like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) emphasize the financial materiality of these risks to corporate and institutional performance. The widespread adoption of the TNFD by over 320 institutions, including major banks and asset managers, underscores the influence of investor demand for transparency and the need to assess portfolio exposures to nature-related risks [@TNFD2023].

- *Global Regulatory Alignment*

The harmonization of sustainability reporting standards, led by initiatives such as the ISSB's IFRS S1 and S2 and the TNFD, promotes consistency and comparability across jurisdictions. These frameworks explicitly reference global commitments like the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, solidifying their role in supporting international biodiversity and sustainability goals.

- *Integration with Financial Reporting*

Mandates under frameworks such as the ISSB standards [@IFRS2023S1] and the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) require nature-related disclosures to be included in financial statements. This integration enhances the rigor of sustainability reporting, ensuring it is held to the same standards of accuracy and reliability as financial data.

However, this transition also presents significant challenges that must be addressed for effective implementation.

- *Legal and Political Barriers*

Legal and political resistance has hindered the implementation of mandatory disclosures in some jurisdictions. For example, the SEC’s Climate Disclosure Rule in the United States has faced significant legal challenges, delaying its roll-out and highlighting the contentious nature of regulatory enforcement in this domain.

- *Complexity of Frameworks*

The proliferation of overlapping frameworks, including the TNFD, ISSB, and various regional regulations, creates challenges for organizations, particularly those operating in multiple jurisdictions. These entities must navigate differing requirements, increasing the complexity and administrative burden of compliance.

- *Data Availability and Granularity*

Effective nature-related disclosure requires detailed and location-specific data, such as ecosystem impacts and value chain dependencies. Many organizations, especially those in sectors with intricate supply chains, face difficulties in accessing or generating the necessary data to meet disclosure requirements.
