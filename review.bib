   abstract = {The growing consensus about dominant coalitions is that, at the symbolic action level, they construct and maintain belief systems that assure the compliance, commitment, and positive sentiments of organizational members and relevant publics. This is referred to as the strategy-legitimacy nexus. Presently, understanding of the strategy-legitimacy nexus is limited, and there is a need for a "thick description" of the nexus to sort out the structures of signification. Most students of the interpretive process focus on 3 kinds of organizational data: 1. public statements, 2. internal documents, and 3. leadership and stakeholder interactions. A broadening of this conception is proposed through a 4-level taxonomy of activity. The 4 levels include: 1. the "official" level, 2. the "spoken" level, 3. the "unspoken" level, and 4. the "unarticulated" level. It is argued that the establishment of legitimacy is a collective process in which leaders, followers, and stakeholders participate in the making of meaning.},

In an effort to place this research in context the paper begins by making reference to contemporary trends occurring in social and environmental accounting research generally, and this is then followed by an overview of some of the many research questions which are currently being addressed in the area. Understanding motivations for disclosure is shown to be one of the issues attracting considerable research attention, and the desire to legitimise an organisation's operations is in turn shown to be one of the many possible motivations. The role of legitimacy theory in explaining managers' decisions is then discussed and it is emphasised that legitimacy theory, as it is currently used, must still be considered to be a relatively under-developed theory of managerial behaviour. Nevertheless, it is argued that the theory provides useful insights. Finally, the paper indicates how the other papers in this issue of AAAJ contribute to the ongoing development of legitimacy theory in SAR research.},

   journal = {The British Accounting Review},
   volume = {36},
   number = {2},
   pages = {197-218},
   abstract = {In recent years, it has come to be recognised that banks' lending operations affect, and are affected by, the state of the natural environment. In particular, rising public concern about the state of the natural environment, as reflected in legislation and consumer attitudes, poses risks for the state of a bank's lending portfolio. Even if they are not directly concerned about the environment, banks therefore have an incentive to understand the environmental implications of their lending decisions. This generates a potential demand for environmental information on companies. This paper reports on empirical research conducted to explore the interface between bank lending and the demand for environmental information. Based on a postal questionnaire survey of banks engaged in corporate lending in the UK, supplemented by a programme of semi-structured interviews, it reports on: the extent to which UK banks incorporate environmental considerations into their corporate lending decisions; the sources of information used by banks when making corporate lending decisions which involve environmental considerations; and lending bankers' views on developments in environmental reporting. The results indicate, inter alia, the importance that bankers attach to the annual report, notwithstanding its traditional limitations as a source of information on corporate environmental impact, and some desire for extensions to environmental disclosure. However, those desired developments are relatively narrow in scope, mirroring banks' principal interest in protecting their loans, and tend not to extend to more comprehensive forms of environmental disclosure such as might be expected to be found in a separate corporate environmental report.},

We develop a framework to assess the social responsibility of internationally operating banks.

Results show that investors appreciate the additional and complementary disclosure provided by the sustainability report and that this disclosure produces a positive effect on stock prices. Estimates of the indirect effects demonstrate that it has a negative influence on book value per share, whereas the effect on earnings per share is not significant. Cross-country analysis shows that the value relevance of the sustainability report varies across European countries, consistent with the hypothesis that the value relevance of the sustainability report is likely to be influenced by different institutional contexts.},

We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem. The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.

Further, initiating firms with superior social responsibility performance attract dedicated institutional investors and analyst coverage.

Finally, we find that firms exploit the benefit of a lower cost of equity capital associated with the initiation of CSR disclosure.

The results hold using 2SLS considering the reverse side of information asymmetry influencing CSR activities. The results also hold after mitigating endogeneity based on the dynamic panel system generalized method of moment. Furthermore, the CSR–information asymmetry relation is amplified in high-risk firms due to managers’ efforts to build a good reputation. Last, we find that CSR engagement is inversely associated with reputational risk measure and lower predicted value of reputational risk is positively associated with lower information asymmetry measures. We interpret these results as supporting the stakeholder theory-based, reputation-building explanation that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to build and maintain firm reputation thereby enhancing the information environment.},

This paper leverages institutional theory by proposing that stakeholders – including governments, regulators, customers, competitors, community and environmental interest groups, and industry associations – impose coercive and normative pressures on firms. However, the way in which managers perceive and act upon these pressures at the plant level depends upon plant- and parent-company-specific factors, including their track record of environmental performance, the competitive position of the parent company and the organizational structure of the plant. Beyond providing a framework of how institutional pressures influence plants' environmental management practices, various measures are proposed to quantify institutional pressures, key plant-level and parent-company-level characteristics and plant-level environmental management practices.

Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a synthesis of interdisciplinary perspectives on sustainable development and integration of this with the accounting for sustainability literature. In addition, potential accounting research contributions are proposed so as to support the development of new research avenues. Findings Existing research in accounting that is relevant to individual SDGs serves as an initial link between them and the accounting discipline. At the same time, the SDGs focus highlights new sites for empirical work (including interdisciplinary investigations) as well as inviting innovation in accounting theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the SDGs provide a context for (re)invigorating accounting’s contribution to sustainable development debates. Originality/value This is the first paper to explore the roles academic accounting can play in furthering achievement of the SDGs through enhanced understanding, critiquing and advancing of accounting policy, practice and theorizing. It is also the first paper to propose a research agenda in this area.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, efforts to value and protect ecosystem services have been promoted by many as the last, best hope for making conservation mainstream – attractive and commonplace worldwide. In theory, if we can help individuals and institutions to recognize the value of nature, then this should greatly increase investments in conservation, while at the same time fostering human well-being. In practice, however, we have not yet developed the scientific basis, nor the policy and finance mechanisms, for incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions on a large scale. Here, we propose a conceptual framework and sketch out a strategic plan for delivering on the promise of ecosystem services, drawing on emerging examples from Hawai‘i. We describe key advances in the science and practice of accounting for natural capital in the decisions of individuals, communities, corporations, and governments.},

abstract = {The topic of sustainable finance is of growing interest for political scientists as we witness a series of new policy initiatives, regulations, and campaigns at global, supranational, and national levels. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of discourses and initiatives related to the promotion of sustainable finance in Germany. It sheds light on the role and actions of different stakeholders in this field, including government-led policy initiatives, the banking and insurance sector, as well as nonprofit organisations and their networks. Interviews were carried out with three mainstream banks and one asset management group on how they are responding to this new trend in finance. For a long time, Germany has not been a frontrunner in sustainable finance but latest figures show a strong upward trend. This paper argues that many initiatives from different types of stakeholders, including civil society organisations, have contributed to broadening debates and deepening discourses and, thus, have promoted the mainstreaming of sustainable finance in Germany. Initiatives at the global level and at the level of the European Union, especially the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, resonate well in Germany. }

Using data culled from 4458 observations from 60 different countries for 10 years (2008–2017), we investigate the effect of the Environment, Social and Governance score (ESG) and the three pillars on banks’ performance [Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobin’s Q (TQ)]. We also control for bank-specific, macroeconomic and governance effects. The findings pinpoint a negative relationship between ESG on one hand and operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ) on the other hand. From regional and pillar perspectives, the performance is differently affected following ESG, pillar and region perspectives. The novelty of this paper lies in the inclusion of different political and economic contexts. Our findings have significant theoretical implications for policy makers and academics at the international level. Banks and financial services sectors’ management lacunae manifest in terms of the weak nexus between ESG, pillars and banks and financial services’ performance. }

abstract = { The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been subject to extensive empirical enquiry. Yet the body of evidence that has accumulated about the nature of the relationship is equivocal. A commonly identified reason for the diverse and contradictory results is measurement issues pertaining to both concepts of interest. This article aims to review alternative operationalisations and measurement approaches for the CSR and CFP concepts that have been deployed in empirical literature concerned with the CSR–CFP relationship. Several findings emanate from our study. First, CSR operationalisations in empirical literature range from multidimensional to one-dimensional. Second, CSR measurement approaches include reputation indices, content analyses, questionnaire-based surveys and one-dimensional measures, whereas CFP measurement approaches include accounting-based measures, market-based measures and combined measures. Third, no CSR measurement approach is without drawbacks. In addition to approach specific drawbacks, two problems inherent in most approaches are researcher subjectivity and selection bias that may influence the nature of CSR–CFP relationship detected in empirical literature. Finally, potential pathways to remedy these drawbacks are suggested. }

This study uses bank- and country-specific control variables to measure the relationship between sustainability reporting and bank performance. Findings The findings deduced from the empirical results demonstrate that ESG improves banks’ accounting and market-based performance in developed countries, supporting value creation theory. Using pooling regression and instrumental variable – generalized method of moments, this study finds that ESG weakens banks’ performance in developed and developing countries. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare the impact of sustainability reporting on banks’ performance in developed and developing countries.

Faced with this dilemma, bank managers are hesitant to engage in CSR.

We apply three novel estimation methods to obtain the unbiased and full-blown CSR effect. The first two methods are matching methods, namely, conventional propensity score matching method and nearest-neighbor variance bias-corrected matching method (nn-VBC). The third method is Heckman's two-step method in switching regression. Regardless of the methods used, CSR banks overwhelmingly outperform non-CSR banks in terms of return on assets and return on equity.

This study shows how commercial banks can identify and prioritize the SDGs and targets and how sustainable practices at the corporate level can contribute to achieving these global goals by adopting a sound methodological approach. The empirical results indicate a significant variation between three perspectives including financial materiality, double materiality, and double materiality with fuzzy logic and some of the SASB issues and GRI issues are more material to a particular SDG than others. There are few studies that focus on developing such a multi-perspective methodology, and this study further contributes to the existing knowledge by shedding light on the SDG Impact Index of commercial banks’ with double materiality perspective.

Using a sample of 142 banks from 35 countries covering the period from 2011 to 2015, we document the positive impact of effective corporate governance mechanisms on banks' environmental engagement. Moreover, by using the Heckman's two-stage model for the treatment of sample selection bias, we find that banks that are more sensitive to environmental issues also exhibit less risk.

The existing literature finds a positive association between bank performance and sustainability, but tends to neglect the risk dimension. As human-driven processes interact with global social-ecological connectivity and exhibit cross-scale relationships, we investigate whether sustainability affects banks’ individual default risk and their systemic risk, that is, their contribution to the risk of the financial system. As banks are financial intermediaries and there is no direct measure of their sustainability, we proxy for sustainability with banks’ performance on environmental, social, and governance attributes, especially their policies and performance. We control for relevant bank, market and country characteristics. It shows that higher sustainability scores of banks significantly associate with lower default risk. We also establish that outperformance on sustainability reduces banks’ contribution to systemic risk. Thus, it appears that banks’ sustainability performance can spill over to the financial system. This implies sustainability is material for banks and their supervisors. Accounting for sustainability can augment bank risk management and prudential policy decision making, and provide guidance as to how to finance a transition towards an economic system that effectively internalizes externalities.},

We find that high ESG scores are associated with a modest reduction in risk-taking for banks that are high or low risk-takers, and that the impact is conditional on executive board characteristics. These findings are consistent with the “stakeholder” view of ESG activities. However, high ESG scores are also associated with a reduction in bank value consistent with the “overinvestment” view of ESG whereby scare resources are diverted from investment. The decline in bank value occurs notwithstanding a positive indirect link between ESG scores and bank value through their impact on risk taking. We conclude that there is a trade-off between reducing bank risk-taking and a more stable financial system on the one hand and bank value on the other.},

Using a sample of European banks operating in 21 countries over 2005–2017, we find that the total ESG score, as well as its sub-pillars, reduces bank fragility during periods of financial distress. This stabilizing effect holds strongly for banks with higher ESG ratings. These results are confirmed by a differences-in-differences (DID) analysis built around the introduction of the EU 2014 Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Our evidence also reveals that, in times of financial turmoil, the longer the duration of ESG disclosures, the greater the benefits on stability. Finally, we show that the ESG–bank stability linkages vary significantly across banks’ characteristics and operating environments. Our findings are robust to selection bias and endogeneity concerns. Overall, they support the regulatory effort in requiring an enhanced disclosure of non–financial information. }

Using a sample of 582 banks worldwide over the period from 2002 to 2018, we confirm a risk-reducing effect of the corporate social responsibility activity on an aggregated level. The decomposition of this effect suggests that environmental activities determine this risk mitigation. In contrast, social and governance activities do not show similarly unambiguous results.

Specifically, shareholder-friendly corporate governance results in higher risk for larger banks and for banks that are located in countries with generous financial safety nets as banks try to shift risk toward taxpayers. We confirm our findings by comparing banks to nonfinancial firms and examining changes in bank risk around an exogenous regulatory change in governance. Our results underline the importance of the financial safety net and too-big-to-fail guarantees in thinking about corporate governance reforms at banks.},

Each financial institution’s contribution to systemic risk can be measured as its systemic expected shortfall (SES), that is, its propensity to be undercapitalized when the system as a whole is undercapitalized. SES increases in the institution’s leverage and its marginal expected shortfall (MES), that is, its losses in the tail of the system’s loss distribution. We demonstrate empirically the ability of components of SES to predict emerging systemic risk during the financial crisis of 2007–2009.Received December 1, 2015; editorial decision August 5, 2016 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.},

Three motives, namely, strategic choices, altruism, and greenwashing, suggest that the relationship between CSR and FP is positive, non-negative, and non-existent, respectively. We obtained our sample, which covered 2003–2009, from the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS) databank and Bankscope database. The data consists of 162 banks in 22 countries. We then classified the banks into four types based on their degree of engagement in CSR. This study proposes the use of an extended version of the Heckman two-step regression, in which the first step adopts a multinomial logit model, and the second step estimates the performance equation with the inverse Mills ratio generated by the first step. The empirical results show that CSR positively associates with FP in terms of return on assets, return on equity, net interest income, and non-interest income. In contrast, CSR negatively associates with non-performing loans. Hence, strategic choice is the primary motive of banks to engage in CSR.},

By applying the value relevance analysis to a sample of 130 European-listed banks, the present work proposes a key to understanding the relationship between social reporting and the value that the market attributes to banks that publicize their commitment to CSR through social reporting. The analysis for the entire sample does not provide evidence that investors attribute value relevance to social reporting (i.e. there is not a significant correlation between the publication of a social report and the stock price). Cross-country analysis shows that in some countries the social report is value-relevant, and positively affects the stock price; in others it remains value-relevant but negatively affects the stock price. Our findings could have several implications for banks, investors, and policymakers. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

This lending disparity happens at both the county and census tract level, worsens in disaster areas of severe hurricane strikes, is robust to alternative ESG ratings (including using only the social (S) component), and cannot be explained by banks’ differential deposit networks. We find no difference in mortgage default rates between high- and low-ESG banks, rejecting an alternative explanation based on differential credit screening quality. We report a complementary, not substitution, relation between high-ESG banks’ mortgage lending and their community development investments (like affordable housing projects) in poor localities. Loan-application-level analyses confirm that high-ESG banks are more likely than low-ESG banks to reject mortgage loans in poor neighborhoods. The evidence hints at social wash: banks deploy prosocial rhetoric and symbolic actions while not lending much in disadvantaged communities, the social function they arguably ought to perform. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examinations partially undo the social wash effect.},

Although that corporate social reporting has been analysed from different perspectives, legitmacy theory currently is the dominating perspective. Authors employing this framework suggest that social and environmental disclosures are responses to both public pressure and increased media attention resulting from major social incidents such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the chemical leak in Bhopal (India). More specifically, those authors argue that the increase in social disclosures represent a strategy to alter the public's perception about the legitimacy of the organisation. Therefore, we suggest using corporate communication as an overarching framework to study corporate social reporting in which "corporate image" and "corporate identity" are central.},

They offer a multilevel and multidisciplinary theoretical framework that synthesizes and integrates the literature at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels of analysis. The framework includes reactive and proactive predictors of CSR actions and policies and the outcomes of such actions and policies, which they classify as primarily affecting internal (i.e., internal outcomes) or external (i.e., external outcomes) stakeholders. The framework includes variables that explain underlying mechanisms (i.e., relationship- and value-based mediator variables) of CSR–outcomes relationships and contingency effects (i.e., people-, place-, price-, and profile-based moderator variables) that explain conditions under which the relationship between CSR and its outcomes change. The authors’ review reveals important knowledge gaps related to the adoption of different theoretical orientations by researchers studying CSR at different levels of analysis, the need to understand underlying mechanisms linking CSR with outcomes, the need for research at micro levels of analysis (i.e., individuals and teams), and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps. Accordingly, they offer a detailed research agenda for the future, based on a multilevel perspective that aims to integrate diverse theoretical frameworks as well as develop an understanding of underlying mechanisms and microfoundations of CSR (i.e., foundations based on individual action and interactions). The authors also provide specific suggestions regarding research design, measurement, and data-analytic approaches that will be instrumental in carrying out their proposed research agenda. }

Themes were observed in multiple research fields, suggesting broad appeal. The authors noted a substantial rise in stakeholder theory's prominence since 1995 and documented that the theory has detractors insofar as it questions shareholders' wealth maximization as the most fundamental objective of business. The authors' recommendations include urging more empirical research across a broader set of organizations apart from large publicly traded corporations, more qualitative research to document cognitive aspects of how managers respond to stakeholder expectations, and a return to the theory's emphasis on the strategic benefits of stakeholder management, albeit with a broader view of firm performance. }

Social disclosure data were captured from annual corporate reports between 1975 and 1997. Results suggest that legitimacy theory may be an explanation of disclosure in some cases but not in others. The distorting effects of perception (of legitimacy‐threatening factors) and the increase in choices of disclosure media partly explain the mixed results and these factors and it is suggested, challenge the usefulness of future “annual‐report only” studies.},

The hypotheses were tested with data collected from large American firms and Lohm&#xf6;ller's partial-least-squares latent variable path analysis. Buffering is found to be positively associated with environmental uncertainty and organizational power. Bridging is positively associated with uncertainty and an institution-oriented philosophy on the part of top management.},

On the basis of a dataset of Western European listed companies, we use a moderation analysis of panel data to examine whether firm size and age drive the impact of CSR on firm value. Our estimations show that the relationship between CSR and firm value is moderated by firm size and age so that it is negatively impacted when small and/or young companies are considered. This finding seems to be consistent with the view that CSR initiatives could be ineffective in smaller and younger companies due to their lack of financial resources, experience, reputation, and so forth. Implications for firms are also discussed.},

The potential moderating role of firm size and age has also been studied in an effort to disentangle their relationships in this context. In particular, the analysis involves interaction effects for two types of firms: full-service and low-cost carriers. Based on the collected data from 38 airlines worldwide for the period 2009 to 2019, we observed that contributions to governance initiatives improve a firm’s market-to-book ratio. We also found that a firm’s participation in social and environmental activities is positively and significantly rewarded by a higher level of financial efficiency. Additionally, firm size is the relevant moderator for the association between sustainability disclosure and both firm value and FP in the air transport industry. We therefore propose that a managerial strategy of participating in these initiatives may adapt them based on their total assets as proxy of firm size. In regard to firm age, we did not find it to be a significant moderator.},

This study extends a previous research (Guerello et al., North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 2018, 48, 591–612) by including ESG scores as determinant of the probability to be sanctioned. The econometric analyses in this paper are based on a sample of 13 Italian banks for the years 2008–2018 and includes ESG scores provided by both Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg. The research shows that ESG score and the probability of sanctions are positively related. However, a careful analysis of causal directions clarifies the meaning of such positive relationship: receiving financial penalties is detrimental for banks reputations, therefore it's necessary for banks to improve their reputation through the adoption of ESG practices.},

   abstract = {Both UN Agenda 2030 and the Directive n. 2014/95/EU have recently promoted a marked improvement in sustainability disclosure, especially for larger companies or groups. Starting from this premise, we carried out an original study on the financial materiality of the E-S-G (environmental, social and governance) information of primary companies listed on major European indices in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain (BEL, CAC, DAX, FTSE-MIB, IBEX). Within the Stakeholder Theory and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)–Corporate Social Perfomance (CSP) framework, our empirical analysis examined the impact of non-financial results (assessed through sustainability indicators) on economic (financial and market) performance in the timespan 2014–2017. We propose a different approach from previous studies, based on a PLS (Partial least squares)/SEM (Structural equation modeling) methodology together with the unprecedented consideration of “ESG” measures (Environmental, Social and Governance), either absolute (scores) or relative (extra-performance over industry sector). We find that, despite the absolute level of the individual ESG scores not being impactful, the “distance” from the industry average–normal figures (excess or abnormal ESG performance) is positively relevant, collaterally revisiting the notion of competitive advantage in sustainability terms. Corporate size is shown to be a significant background factor (as slack resources proxy). Social, environmental and governance responsibility (to all stakeholders) appear to be important as a competitive factor of the modern firm.},

However, a thorough investigation of ESG scores is a neglected topic in the literature. This paper uses Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG ratings to analyze the influence of firm size, a company's available resources for providing ESG data, and the availability of a company's ESG data on the company's sustainability performance.

The results raise the question of whether the way the ESG score measures corporate sustainability gives an advantage to larger firms with more resources while not providing SR investors with the information needed to make decisions based on their beliefs. Due to our results, SR investors and scholars should reopen the discussion about: what sustainability rating agencies measure with ESG scores, what exactly needs to be measured, and if the sustainable finance community can reach their self-imposed objectives with this measurement.]},

The authors applied the methodology of content analysis and developed indexes. Panel regression was performed to improve and ensure the robustness of this study. Findings The results show that social and governance aspects dominate the ESG preparedness; however, after 2019, there was a significant improvement in the integration of environmental issues. This study confirms a strong association between bank size (total assets) and ESG reporting, and between capital adequacy and ESG reporting. The results demonstrate that there is no connection between banks' operational and financial performance and ESG disclosure.

Practical implications This study also adds to the existing research in the field of sustainability reporting.

abstract = {Abstract Many firms choose to communicate their environmental strategies through voluntary environmental disclosures. This paper examines patterns in the quality of voluntary environmental disclosures made by a sample of around 450 large UK companies drawn from a diverse range of industrial sectors. The analysis distinguishes between five facets of quality, including the disclosure of group-wide environmental policies, environmental impact targets and an environmental audit. We examine how the decisions firms face regarding each facet of quality are determined by firm and industry characteristics, and find the quality of disclosure to be determined by a firm's size and the nature of its business activities. Specifically, we find high quality disclosure to be primarily associated with larger firms and those in sectors most closely related to environmental concerns. In contrast to several recent contributions, we find that the media exposure of companies plays no role in stimulating voluntary disclosures.

   abstract = {Purpose Aims to demonstrate whether consumers influence provision of environmental communications by the UK food sector, challenging the view that such reporting is principally targeted at institutional stakeholders and shareholders. Design/methodology/approach Web site research was undertaken on a sample of 43 manufacturers and 16 retailers on provision of environmental information of a policy (intent) or reporting (action‐based) nature, analysed using chi‐square techniques assessing the significance of turnover, public listing, brand‐name companies, consumer‐goods companies and media allegations on the provision of environmental information. Findings Turnover, public listing, brand‐names, consumer‐focus and media allegations all affected provision of environmental information by UK food companies, suggesting that greater consumer‐focus leads to the perception that provision of such information into the public/consumer domain is important. Research limitations/implications The sample size selected was relatively small, and findings were based on the assumption that the internet is an accurate and appropriate means of conveying environmental information to the consumer. Further research could test such findings with a larger sample and a consumer survey to confirm interest in corporate environmental information provision. Practical implications There are important implications for UK food companies considering environmental actions and communications, particularly for brand‐name‐ or consumer‐focused companies. Reporting is seen as a necessary defence but may also offer opportunities for differentiated competitive advantage. Originality/value This paper is very valuable in challenging the traditional view that corporate environmental reporting is largely of interest to shareholders and other institutional stakeholders.

   abstract = {In order to help understand the environmental disclosure mechanism from the corporate perspective, this paper identifies the determinant factors affecting the disclosure level of corporate environmental information on the basis of stakeholder theory, and gives an empirical observation on Chinese listed companies. The corporate environmental information disclosure (EID) level appears to be marginal in current Chinese context. Nearly 40% of the sampled companies opened no substantial environmental data to the public as could be seen from the content analysis of disclosed information. The present condition is that the EID strategy of Chinese listed companies is oriented to fill up the government's environmental concerns. The corporate EID effort is significantly relative to its environmental sensitivity (a proxy of the pressure from the government) and its size. The role of other stakeholders, like shareholders and creditors tested in this study in effecting the EID, is found to be still weak. Another interesting finding is that the sampled companies are selectively opening their environmental information. Companies operating in eastern coastal regions, where the economy has been relatively developed, are more likely to disclose emission-related data. The better the company's economic performance, the more information on environmental investment and pollution control cost is disclosed. More concerns of the firm's stakeholders on environmental issues shall be promoted in order to encourage Chinese enterprises to disclose more environmental information and accordingly become more proactive for improving their environmental performance.},

Both internal and external forces potentially drive community-related CSR decisions. It is hence important to understand the role of internal constraints arising due to agency problems along with institutional pressures from external stakeholders in emerging markets in shaping CSR. In this study, we draw on agency theory and sociological perspectives of institutions to explore variations in the motivation of different owners to pursue a socially responsible agenda. Our analysis of a sample of Indian firms for the period 2008–2015 illustrates that business group and family ownership is beneficial for community-related CSR. Our theoretical arguments and results highlight the importance of combining multiple lenses to assess the influence of ownership structures on CSR in emerging markets.},

   abstract = {The main aim of this study is to investigate the influence of institutional investors’ ownership (INOW) on firms’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting in Saudi Arabia. Using data on ESG reporting from the Bloomberg database for 206 Saudi-listed firms spanning the period from 2010 to 2019 and employing ordinary least squares regression (OLS), the results show a significant and positive association between INOW and ESG reporting. When institutional investors are classified into government and privately managed institutions, the research findings clearly show that only government-managed institutional investors (Govt_IO) are linked to ESG reporting in a positive and significant way, whereas there is no significant association between privately managed institutions (Prvt_IO) and ESG reporting. In addition, when the ESG score is disaggregated by individual pillars, we find Govt_IO is positively associated with environmental score and social score. These results suggest that the association between INOW and ESG varies depending on the types of INOW, as well as the ESG components. Even after several additional analyses, including tests for endogeneity, the main results of this study still hold.},

   abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), ownership structure, and investment efficiency in the Saudi stock market. Analyzing data from non-financial companies listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) from 2016 to 2021, the findings revealed that higher CSR disclosures were positively associated with investment efficiency. Additionally, the study found that firms with higher levels of institutional, family, or foreign ownership demonstrated more efficient investment practices. However, the study did not support the moderation effect of ownership structure on the CSR–investment efficiency nexus. These results remain robust across different alternative measures and methods. This research fills a gap in the literature by examining these relationships in an emerging market with unique governance and ownership structures. Specifically, it extends the understanding of the CSR–investment efficiency nexus beyond developed economies to include the developing context of Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the study highlights the varying effects of different ownership structures on investment efficiency and provides a detailed analysis of how investor types respond to CSR disclosures, revealing differences from established CSR frameworks in developed markets. The study’s results offer new insights for investors, policymakers, and regulators, and open avenues for further research for academics and business professionals.},

The results obtained for a sample of 989 international companies, which prepare their sustainability reports following the GRI guidelines, show that ownership by foreign investors, pension funds, and “other” investors boosts the relevance of the information disclosed in relation to the 2030 Agenda.

By using a unique longitude data set of Chinese publicly traded manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2016, this study finds that ownership structure and board characteristics are significantly associated with firms’ decisions to voluntarily disclose CSR reports. In particular, our study finds that state ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership and board size are positively and significantly associated with the decision to voluntarily disclose CSR reports. However, board independence is not related to the decision. We also find CEO duality is negatively and significantly related to the decision. Our findings highlight the role of corporate governance in firms’ transparency by influencing the voluntary disclosure of additional information on firms’ CSR activities. }

We test these assumptions using a sample of 2,480 firm-year observations from 529 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in the period 2015–2019. The findings indicate that there is a negative association between institutional ownership and disclosure of the social performance, both in general and particularly so in the case of ownership by mutual funds or corporate pension funds.

It can better represent existing relationships between the company and its stakeholders, with a particular focus on investors. Attention to IR has grown considerably in recent years. However, studies on the determinants of IR quality are still limited. This study aims to bridge this literature gap by being the first study to analyse the role of ownership structure in IR context. To this end, it uses agency theory and is based on a sample of 152 international companies that have adopted IR. The results indicate a positive effect of institutional ownership and a negative effect of ownership concentration, managerial ownership and state ownership on the quality of integrated reports. These results are also consistent with the level of alignment of integrated reports with the <IR> framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the role of ownership structure in the IR policies.},

The empirical data in this study is based on annual financial statements and such websites. A multi-theoretical framework is used in order to explain the extent and content of social disclosures on corporate websites. The findings support the positive correlation of size and profitability with the content of social disclosure information on these websites. In general, State-owned corporations disclose more social information on their websites than privately owned corporations do. There are significant differences between different industries.

Our sample was comprised of 207 listed firms with data among the period between 2012 and 2019. We collected firms financial data and CSR reports, which were analyzed through logistic regression models. The main results suggest that the higher the concentration of equity shares with voting rights in the hands of the largest shareholder, or even the aggregate shares of the three largest ones, the less likely the firm is to voluntarily disclose CSR reports. This research demonstrates the relevance of legitimacy theory to explain aspects concerning capital markets and corporate reports disclosure. It also indicates a possible principal-principal conflict, in which the largest shareholders are not inclined to disclose CSR reports that could bring informational benefits to minority shareholders. Finally, this study highlights the need to protect minority shareholders in respect to their demands for voluntary CSR information.Alternate abstract:O objetivo deste estudo é examinar a relaçâo entre a concentraçao de propriedade e controle e a divulgaçâo voluntaria de relatónos de responsabilidade social corporativa (RSC).

We find that the issuance of green banking regulatory guidance by the Central Bank of Bangladesh in 2011 positively influences the level of green banking disclosure. We also report that green banking disclosure practices in the banking sector have converged over time and have become a routine process. In addition, we find that corporate governance mechanisms (e.g., board size and institutional ownership) positively affect the level of green banking disclosure. However, our study finds no relationship between the presence of independent directors on the board and green banking disclosure.

   abstract = {Purpose This study aims to study the response of the stock market to the announcement of compulsory environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure regulation in the context of the Indian economy – one of the largest emerging economies. The study also examines the role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure. Design/methodology/approach Daily stock price data of 940 listed companies has been collected for 276 trading days to compute abnormal returns. The current study is based on event study methodology to analyze the announcement effect of disclosure regulations. Furthermore, to check the robustness of results, cross-sectional regression has been applied to correct for potential heterogeneity. Findings Results of the event study signify that the equity share market has reacted positively and significantly to the mandatory ESG disclosure regulation. Furthermore, the study also confirms the mitigating role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure as carbon nonsensitive (non predisclosure) firms have witnessed a more intense effect of regulation as compared to sensitive (predisclosed) corporations. Practical implications Current findings assist managers in understanding investor perception toward nonfinancial disclosures. Corporate managers can use disclosure as a tool to enhance the firm value and reduce information asymmetry by providing relevant information. Furthermore, policymakers can use the findings of present research to disseminate the advantages of adopting ESG disclosure practices thereby improving the transparency and governance among business firms. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to provide empirical evidence on the market response to compulsory ESG disclosure framework in the emerging context of India. Furthermore, considering the infancy stage of ESG research, the present research contributes to the body of knowledge by empirically testing the disclosure theories.},

We document a positive effect of ESG disclosure mandates on firm-level stock liquidity. The effects are strongest if the disclosure requirements are implemented by government institutions, not on a comply-or-explain basis, and coupled with strong enforcement by informal institutions. Firms with weaker information environments benefit more from ESG disclosure mandates. Our results support the view that ESG disclosure regulation improves the information environment and has beneficial capital market effects.},

We used a difference-in-difference approach to solve endogenous concerns and found that the negative impact of the ESG score on extreme risk is more significant after announcing compulsory disclosure regulations. Additionally, we demonstrated that this effect becomes more substantial when firms issue green bonds.

Specifically, we explore the implications of the European Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) mandating disclosure on non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies. To identify the effect of the EU disclosure regulation on firms' ESG scores, we performed a differences-in-differences estimation using a sample of EU firms as the treated group and a sample of US firms as the control group in the period 2015–2020. Overall, our findings suggest that regulatory efforts to increase the transparency of the social and environmental impacts of firms' activities on society are effective at improving disclosure commitment and effectiveness. Hence, regulation supports the adoption of ESG strategies to the benefit of the whole society. The study provides a fresh comparison between regulating or not the ESG information market, drawing suggestions for future policy.},

This study examines whether banks that commit to self-regulation by adopting the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) exhibit enhanced Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance. Utilizing Bloomberg ratings, we find that PRB adopters consistently show higher ESG scores than non-adopters, both before and after adoption. This suggests that a commitment to self-regulation serves as a reliable signal of responsible banking practices. Notably, the superior performance of PRB adopters relative to non-adopters is primarily driven by a strong pre-adoption commitment to transparency on ESG issues. We discuss possible explanations for this trend, including the role of early adopters in advancing industry-wide standards. Additionally, our findings reveal a negative association between regulatory quality and ESG scores, implying that banks may leverage ESG disclosures to mitigate information asymmetries in weaker institutional environments.},

I use a setting of U.S. firms borrowing from non-U.S. banks and exploit the staggered adoption of ESG disclosure regulations in banks’ home countries. I find that exposed borrowers of affected banks improve their environmental and social (E\&S) performance following the disclosure mandate. Consistent with banks enhancing both their engagement and selection activities, affected banks impose more environmental action covenants in loan contracts, and they are more likely to terminate a borrower with bad E\&S records following the regulation. Further evidence shows that the transmission effects are stronger when a disclosure regulation is well-enforced (as indicated by a greater increase in banks’ disclosure) and among borrowers with greater switching costs. Collectively, the findings document the role of lending relationships in transmitting the real effect of ESG disclosure regulations from banks to borrowing firms.},

   abstract = {Despite the key role played by banks in shifting the global economy toward sustainable development, little is known about how the integration of environmental considerations into their lending decisions affects their market valuation. Using a sample of announcements of bank loans issued by Chinese listed banks and an event study methodology, this study examines how the market values the green credit performance of banks. We find that banks with superior green credit performance have significantly higher market valuation upon loan announcements. Cross-sectional analyses show that the positive effect of banks' green credit performance is more pronounced when banks are less exposed to political pressures. This positive effect is also stronger when borrowers have strong environmental and social (ES) performance, provide ES disclosures, operate in industries that are not heavily polluting, have high institutional ownership, and are controlled by private shareholders. Finally, our path analysis shows that green credit increases banks' market valuation by improving the prospect of future cash flows and reducing credit risk for banks. Overall, we document that green credit is a value-enhancing practice for banks in emerging markets such as China, where legal institutions and environmental regulations may not be as developed as in more advanced markets.},

Since randomized controlled experiments in the “Business-Research” field are often unfeasible, researchers rely mostly on observational data to make claims about “doing good – doing well” arguments. In response to several strong calls for additional well-crafted empirical research that address endogeneity, we revisit the CSP – CFP relationship, in the airline industry, to understand how endogeneity arises and how to control for it in studies based on observational panel data. We exploit various approaches such as OLS, fixed-effects, fixed-effects IV/2SLS, dynamic system GMM, and GLS estimators. We show the appropriateness behind the use of the dynamic system GMM estimator and its benefits over the fixed-effects estimator. In addition, we demonstrate that results in models that do not account for endogeneity lead to inflated estimations, misleading interpretations and wrong theoretical propositions about the dynamic nature of CSP-CFP relationship.},

In addition, the link between CSP and investor utility is investigated. The main findings are that corporate social responsibility is negatively but weakly related to systematic firm risk and that corporate social irresponsibility is positively and strongly related to financial risk. The fact that both conventional and downside risk measures lead to the same conclusions adds convergent validity to the analysis. However, the risk-return trade-off appears to be such that no clear utility gain or loss can be realized by investing in firms characterized by different levels of social and environmental performance. Overall volatility conditions of the financial markets are shown to play a moderating role in the nature and strength of the CSP-risk relationship.},
