In this article, we examine these three aspects of the theory and critique and integrate important contributions to the literature related to each.

   abstract = {The growing consensus about dominant coalitions is that, at the symbolic action level, they construct and maintain belief systems that assure the compliance, commitment, and positive sentiments of organizational members and relevant publics. This is referred to as the strategy-legitimacy nexus. Presently, understanding of the strategy-legitimacy nexus is limited, and there is a need for a "thick description" of the nexus to sort out the structures of signification. Most students of the interpretive process focus on 3 kinds of organizational data: 1. public statements, 2. internal documents, and 3. leadership and stakeholder interactions. A broadening of this conception is proposed through a 4-level taxonomy of activity. The 4 levels include: 1. the "official" level, 2. the "spoken" level, 3. the "unspoken" level, and 4. the "unarticulated" level. It is argued that the establishment of legitimacy is a collective process in which leaders, followers, and stakeholders participate in the making of meaning.},

In an effort to place this research in context the paper begins by making reference to contemporary trends occurring in social and environmental accounting research generally, and this is then followed by an overview of some of the many research questions which are currently being addressed in the area. Understanding motivations for disclosure is shown to be one of the issues attracting considerable research attention, and the desire to legitimise an organisation's operations is in turn shown to be one of the many possible motivations. The role of legitimacy theory in explaining managers' decisions is then discussed and it is emphasised that legitimacy theory, as it is currently used, must still be considered to be a relatively under-developed theory of managerial behaviour. Nevertheless, it is argued that the theory provides useful insights. Finally, the paper indicates how the other papers in this issue of AAAJ contribute to the ongoing development of legitimacy theory in SAR research.},

   journal = {The British Accounting Review},
   volume = {36},
   number = {2},
   pages = {197-218},
   abstract = {In recent years, it has come to be recognised that banks' lending operations affect, and are affected by, the state of the natural environment. In particular, rising public concern about the state of the natural environment, as reflected in legislation and consumer attitudes, poses risks for the state of a bank's lending portfolio. Even if they are not directly concerned about the environment, banks therefore have an incentive to understand the environmental implications of their lending decisions. This generates a potential demand for environmental information on companies. This paper reports on empirical research conducted to explore the interface between bank lending and the demand for environmental information. Based on a postal questionnaire survey of banks engaged in corporate lending in the UK, supplemented by a programme of semi-structured interviews, it reports on: the extent to which UK banks incorporate environmental considerations into their corporate lending decisions; the sources of information used by banks when making corporate lending decisions which involve environmental considerations; and lending bankers' views on developments in environmental reporting. The results indicate, inter alia, the importance that bankers attach to the annual report, notwithstanding its traditional limitations as a source of information on corporate environmental impact, and some desire for extensions to environmental disclosure. However, those desired developments are relatively narrow in scope, mirroring banks' principal interest in protecting their loans, and tend not to extend to more comprehensive forms of environmental disclosure such as might be expected to be found in a separate corporate environmental report.},

We develop a framework to assess the social responsibility of internationally operating banks.

Results show that investors appreciate the additional and complementary disclosure provided by the sustainability report and that this disclosure produces a positive effect on stock prices. Estimates of the indirect effects demonstrate that it has a negative influence on book value per share, whereas the effect on earnings per share is not significant. Cross-country analysis shows that the value relevance of the sustainability report varies across European countries, consistent with the hypothesis that the value relevance of the sustainability report is likely to be influenced by different institutional contexts.},

We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem. The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.

Further, initiating firms with superior social responsibility performance attract dedicated institutional investors and analyst coverage. Moreover, these analysts achieve lower absolute forecast errors and dispersion. Finally, we find that firms exploit the benefit of a lower cost of equity capital associated with the initiation of CSR disclosure.

The results hold using 2SLS considering the reverse side of information asymmetry influencing CSR activities. The results also hold after mitigating endogeneity based on the dynamic panel system generalized method of moment. Furthermore, the CSR–information asymmetry relation is amplified in high-risk firms due to managers’ efforts to build a good reputation. Last, we find that CSR engagement is inversely associated with reputational risk measure and lower predicted value of reputational risk is positively associated with lower information asymmetry measures. We interpret these results as supporting the stakeholder theory-based, reputation-building explanation that considers CSR engagement as a vehicle to build and maintain firm reputation thereby enhancing the information environment.},

This paper leverages institutional theory by proposing that stakeholders – including governments, regulators, customers, competitors, community and environmental interest groups, and industry associations – impose coercive and normative pressures on firms. However, the way in which managers perceive and act upon these pressures at the plant level depends upon plant- and parent-company-specific factors, including their track record of environmental performance, the competitive position of the parent company and the organizational structure of the plant. Beyond providing a framework of how institutional pressures influence plants' environmental management practices, various measures are proposed to quantify institutional pressures, key plant-level and parent-company-level characteristics and plant-level environmental management practices.

Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a synthesis of interdisciplinary perspectives on sustainable development and integration of this with the accounting for sustainability literature. In addition, potential accounting research contributions are proposed so as to support the development of new research avenues. Findings Existing research in accounting that is relevant to individual SDGs serves as an initial link between them and the accounting discipline. At the same time, the SDGs focus highlights new sites for empirical work (including interdisciplinary investigations) as well as inviting innovation in accounting theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the SDGs provide a context for (re)invigorating accounting’s contribution to sustainable development debates. Originality/value This is the first paper to explore the roles academic accounting can play in furthering achievement of the SDGs through enhanced understanding, critiquing and advancing of accounting policy, practice and theorizing. It is also the first paper to propose a research agenda in this area.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, efforts to value and protect ecosystem services have been promoted by many as the last, best hope for making conservation mainstream – attractive and commonplace worldwide. In theory, if we can help individuals and institutions to recognize the value of nature, then this should greatly increase investments in conservation, while at the same time fostering human well-being. In practice, however, we have not yet developed the scientific basis, nor the policy and finance mechanisms, for incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions on a large scale. Here, we propose a conceptual framework and sketch out a strategic plan for delivering on the promise of ecosystem services, drawing on emerging examples from Hawai‘i. We describe key advances in the science and practice of accounting for natural capital in the decisions of individuals, communities, corporations, and governments.},

abstract = {The topic of sustainable finance is of growing interest for political scientists as we witness a series of new policy initiatives, regulations, and campaigns at global, supranational, and national levels. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of discourses and initiatives related to the promotion of sustainable finance in Germany. It sheds light on the role and actions of different stakeholders in this field, including government-led policy initiatives, the banking and insurance sector, as well as nonprofit organisations and their networks. Interviews were carried out with three mainstream banks and one asset management group on how they are responding to this new trend in finance. For a long time, Germany has not been a frontrunner in sustainable finance but latest figures show a strong upward trend. This paper argues that many initiatives from different types of stakeholders, including civil society organisations, have contributed to broadening debates and deepening discourses and, thus, have promoted the mainstreaming of sustainable finance in Germany. Initiatives at the global level and at the level of the European Union, especially the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, resonate well in Germany. }

Using data culled from 4458 observations from 60 different countries for 10 years (2008–2017), we investigate the effect of the Environment, Social and Governance score (ESG) and the three pillars on banks’ performance [Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobin’s Q (TQ)]. We also control for bank-specific, macroeconomic and governance effects. The findings pinpoint a negative relationship between ESG on one hand and operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ) on the other hand. From regional and pillar perspectives, the performance is differently affected following ESG, pillar and region perspectives. The novelty of this paper lies in the inclusion of different political and economic contexts. Our findings have significant theoretical implications for policy makers and academics at the international level. Banks and financial services sectors’ management lacunae manifest in terms of the weak nexus between ESG, pillars and banks and financial services’ performance. }

abstract = { The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been subject to extensive empirical enquiry. Yet the body of evidence that has accumulated about the nature of the relationship is equivocal. A commonly identified reason for the diverse and contradictory results is measurement issues pertaining to both concepts of interest. This article aims to review alternative operationalisations and measurement approaches for the CSR and CFP concepts that have been deployed in empirical literature concerned with the CSR–CFP relationship. Several findings emanate from our study. First, CSR operationalisations in empirical literature range from multidimensional to one-dimensional. Second, CSR measurement approaches include reputation indices, content analyses, questionnaire-based surveys and one-dimensional measures, whereas CFP measurement approaches include accounting-based measures, market-based measures and combined measures. Third, no CSR measurement approach is without drawbacks. In addition to approach specific drawbacks, two problems inherent in most approaches are researcher subjectivity and selection bias that may influence the nature of CSR–CFP relationship detected in empirical literature. Finally, potential pathways to remedy these drawbacks are suggested. }

This study uses bank- and country-specific control variables to measure the relationship between sustainability reporting and bank performance. Findings The findings deduced from the empirical results demonstrate that ESG improves banks’ accounting and market-based performance in developed countries, supporting value creation theory. Using pooling regression and instrumental variable – generalized method of moments, this study finds that ESG weakens banks’ performance in developed and developing countries. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare the impact of sustainability reporting on banks’ performance in developed and developing countries.

Faced with this dilemma, bank managers are hesitant to engage in CSR.

We apply three novel estimation methods to obtain the unbiased and full-blown CSR effect. The first two methods are matching methods, namely, conventional propensity score matching method and nearest-neighbor variance bias-corrected matching method (nn-VBC). The third method is Heckman's two-step method in switching regression. Regardless of the methods used, CSR banks overwhelmingly outperform non-CSR banks in terms of return on assets and return on equity.

There are few studies that focus on developing such a multi-perspective methodology, and this study further contributes to the existing knowledge by shedding light on the SDG Impact Index of commercial banks’ with double materiality perspective.

Using a sample of 142 banks from 35 countries covering the period from 2011 to 2015, we document the positive impact of effective corporate governance mechanisms on banks' environmental engagement. Moreover, by using the Heckman's two-stage model for the treatment of sample selection bias, we find that banks that are more sensitive to environmental issues also exhibit less risk.

The existing literature finds a positive association between bank performance and sustainability, but tends to neglect the risk dimension. As human-driven processes interact with global social-ecological connectivity and exhibit cross-scale relationships, we investigate whether sustainability affects banks’ individual default risk and their systemic risk, that is, their contribution to the risk of the financial system. As banks are financial intermediaries and there is no direct measure of their sustainability, we proxy for sustainability with banks’ performance on environmental, social, and governance attributes, especially their policies and performance. We control for relevant bank, market and country characteristics. It shows that higher sustainability scores of banks significantly associate with lower default risk. We also establish that outperformance on sustainability reduces banks’ contribution to systemic risk. Thus, it appears that banks’ sustainability performance can spill over to the financial system. This implies sustainability is material for banks and their supervisors. Accounting for sustainability can augment bank risk management and prudential policy decision making, and provide guidance as to how to finance a transition towards an economic system that effectively internalizes externalities.},

We find that high ESG scores are associated with a modest reduction in risk-taking for banks that are high or low risk-takers, and that the impact is conditional on executive board characteristics. These findings are consistent with the “stakeholder” view of ESG activities. However, high ESG scores are also associated with a reduction in bank value consistent with the “overinvestment” view of ESG whereby scare resources are diverted from investment. The decline in bank value occurs notwithstanding a positive indirect link between ESG scores and bank value through their impact on risk taking. We conclude that there is a trade-off between reducing bank risk-taking and a more stable financial system on the one hand and bank value on the other.},

Using a sample of European banks operating in 21 countries over 2005–2017, we find that the total ESG score, as well as its sub-pillars, reduces bank fragility during periods of financial distress. This stabilizing effect holds strongly for banks with higher ESG ratings. These results are confirmed by a differences-in-differences (DID) analysis built around the introduction of the EU 2014 Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Our evidence also reveals that, in times of financial turmoil, the longer the duration of ESG disclosures, the greater the benefits on stability. Finally, we show that the ESG–bank stability linkages vary significantly across banks’ characteristics and operating environments. Our findings are robust to selection bias and endogeneity concerns. Overall, they support the regulatory effort in requiring an enhanced disclosure of non–financial information. }

Using a sample of 582 banks worldwide over the period from 2002 to 2018, we confirm a risk-reducing effect of the corporate social responsibility activity on an aggregated level. The decomposition of this effect suggests that environmental activities determine this risk mitigation. In contrast, social and governance activities do not show similarly unambiguous results.

   abstract = {We find that shareholder-friendly corporate governance is associated with higher stand-alone and systemic risk in the banking sector. Specifically, shareholder-friendly corporate governance results in higher risk for larger banks and for banks that are located in countries with generous financial safety nets as banks try to shift risk toward taxpayers. We confirm our findings by comparing banks to nonfinancial firms and examining changes in bank risk around an exogenous regulatory change in governance. Our results underline the importance of the financial safety net and too-big-to-fail guarantees in thinking about corporate governance reforms at banks.},

   abstract = {We present an economic model of systemic risk in which undercapitalization of the financial sector as a whole is assumed to harm the real economy, leading to a systemic risk externality. Each financial institution’s contribution to systemic risk can be measured as its systemic expected shortfall (SES), that is, its propensity to be undercapitalized when the system as a whole is undercapitalized. SES increases in the institution’s leverage and its marginal expected shortfall (MES), that is, its losses in the tail of the system’s loss distribution. We demonstrate empirically the ability of components of SES to predict emerging systemic risk during the financial crisis of 2007–2009.Received December 1, 2015; editorial decision August 5, 2016 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.},

    abstract = {We introduce SRISK to measure the systemic risk contribution of a financial firm. SRISK measures the capital shortfall of a firm conditional on a severe market decline, and is a function of its size, leverage and risk. We use the measure to study top financial institutions in the recent financial crisis. SRISK delivers useful rankings of systemic institutions at various stages of the crisis and identifies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers as top contributors as early as 2005-Q1. Moreover, aggregate SRISK provides early warning signals of distress in indicators of real activity.Received June 7, 2011; accepted April 18, 2016 by Editor Geert Bekaert.},
